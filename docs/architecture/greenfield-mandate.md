# Greenfield and Compatibility Mandate

## Position

**HTBW Core is a greenfield platform.**

The following are **not required** and must never be introduced as a constraint on HTBW Core design:

- Backward compatibility
- Implementation compatibility
- API compatibility
- Schema compatibility
- Legacy data-model compatibility
- Code reuse
- Compatibility shims
- Migration adapters

> **Scope of the migration-adapter prohibition, settled by DL-52.** This list prohibits compatibility
> **as a constraint on HTBW Core design**, and **DL-19** prohibits **implicit** migration obligations.
> **An explicit, optional, one-way, terminating adoption that constrains no HTBW model is outside
> it.** The prohibition keeps its full force through the rule that **adoption maps into HTBW's own
> accepted models and reports unmappable content as *not adopted*** — the moment an HTBW model is
> shaped by what a legacy product happens to store, this mandate is violated. See
> [adr-product-disposition-and-legacy-adoption.md](adr-product-disposition-and-legacy-adoption.md).

## Status of the reference repositories

> **Disposition is now stated per product by DL-51.** This section is the origin of that asymmetry and
> is reaffirmed by it.

**Asset Intelligence** is a separate, released product with its own lifecycle. It is not merged into
HTBW Core, not deprecated by this refoundation, and not modified by it. **It is not retired**, and
**HTBW must never require it to be installed.** HTBW Core may learn from its concepts, contracts, and
household outcomes, but is not required to depend on it or copy its implementation. **HTBW absorbs
equivalent functionality directly**, and a household's existing Asset Intelligence data may be
**adopted once** under **DL-52**.

**Voice Identity** and **Concierge** were exploratory projects. They revealed important architectural
concepts and household outcomes. **They are not compatibility commitments.** Their functionality is
**absorbed into HTBW and the standalone integrations will sunset** (**DL-51**), while **Identity** and
**Concierge** remain first-class HTBW responsibilities. **Sunset creates no compatibility requirement,
and it is not permission to inherit a sunsetting product's defects.**

No HTBW Core document may cite an existing implementation as a reason to preserve a boundary, schema,
API, module name, or ownership assignment.

| Preserved | Not preserved |
|---|---|
| Proven architectural ideas | Existing project boundaries |
| Valid contracts | Existing integration boundaries |
| Household-facing outcomes | Existing schemas |
| Important scenarios | Existing APIs |
| Accepted vocabulary | Existing module names |
| Explainability requirements | Existing folder structures |
| Behavioral intent | Existing ownership assignments |
| | Existing runtime implementation choices |

## Prohibitions during documentation work

- Do not copy code from the reference repositories into HTBW.
- Do not begin implementing HTBW Core code.
- Do not introduce a compatibility requirement in a contract, model, or ADR.
- Do not preserve an obsolete ownership statement for the sake of a smaller change.
