## 1. Status

**Accepted 2026-08-25.** Raised from a comparative research review of four third-party speaker
recognition projects and a verification pass over the official Wyoming protocol, the Home Assistant
Wyoming integration, and the current reference implementation.

| Aspect | Position |
|---|---|
| Open decision resolved | **OD-80 — Capability execution host** (issue **#153**), accepted as **DL-50** |
| Open decisions engaged but **not** resolved | **OD-07** (voice processing locality, #95), **OD-15** (#96), **OD-66** (#131), **OD-67** (#132), **OD-06** (#94) |
| Open decisions raised | **OD-82** — HTBW product consolidation and retirement (#160); **OD-83** — voiceprint gallery structure under channel diversity (#168); **OD-84** — multi-speaker evidence and speaker plurality (#169) |
| Accepted decisions reopened | **None** |
| Production code changed | **None** |

**What acceptance does and does not do.** It settles **where a capability may execute**, **what a
voice provider returns**, and **what may never happen to a transcript**. It authorises **no
implementation** — the roadmap phases are separately tracked, section 24 remains validation-gated, and
section 25 remains a North Star that this ADR explicitly does not approve.

---

## 2. Context

**Identity is the responsibility. Voice is one evidence source among many.** That is **DL-05**, and
this ADR does not disturb it. Nothing here restores Voice Identity as a platform-service boundary, a
second identity authority, or a separate responsibility.

Three things converged to make this decision necessary.

**A verified hosting failure.** A speaker-embedding encoder declared as a Home Assistant manifest
`requirements` entry had no installable wheel on the target host — no build for the interpreter
version below one release line, and no build for the platform libc above it. Because the manifest
`requirements` install is a **hard precondition for `async_setup_component`**, the resolution failure
failed the **entire integration** before any of its own code ran, regardless of how carefully that
code had been written to degrade without the dependency. This is the failure recorded verbatim in
**OD-80**.

**A verified ecosystem answer.** A review of four independent open-source speaker-recognition projects
for Home Assistant found that **every one of them runs its neural encoder outside the Home Assistant
Core process** — as a Docker container, a Home Assistant app, or a systemd service. Not one attempts
in-process execution. The ecosystem has already answered the question OD-80 asks.

**A verified audio-access boundary.** Speaker evidence requires audio. By the time the Assist pipeline
produces a transcript, the audio is gone. Home Assistant's `SpeechMetadata` carries only
`{language, format, codec, bit_rate, sample_rate, channel}` and no correlation identifiers, so a
speech-to-text provider is structurally unable to know which conversation, device, satellite, or
pipeline run it is serving. The **Wyoming protocol** is the documented, Home-Assistant-supported seam
at which raw streaming audio is available before the text boundary.

---

## 3. Problem statement

Four questions, none of which the repository currently answers.

1. **Where may an HTBW capability execute** when the Home Assistant integration process cannot host
   it, and how is that host declared, governed, and made explainable? (**OD-80**)
2. **How does HTBW obtain runtime audio** for voice evidence without owning speech-to-text, owning the
   conversation agent, or blocking transcription?
3. **What does a voice provider return**, such that Identity can fuse it under **DL-38** without the
   provider having resolved a person, produced fused confidence, or authorized anything?
4. **How is that evidence bound** to the interaction it belongs to, given that the protocol seam does
   not carry the correlation identifiers?

---

## 4. Decision

**Six decisions, stated together.**

### D1 — A capability may declare an execution host, and the host is a DL-41 dependency

An HTBW capability that cannot execute inside the Home Assistant integration process **may declare an
execution host**. The host is named in the capability's dependency declaration and in the Decision
Trace, exactly as any other dependency is. This adopts **OD-80 alternative (D)**, with alternative
**(B)** — a Home Assistant app — as the reference deployment rather than as the architecture.

**(D) rather than (B) alone, deliberately.** **P25** keeps Home Assistant the first implementation
environment and **not a constraint on the architecture**, and OD-80 itself records that apps exist only
on some installation types. A per-capability declared host satisfies both: the architecture names a
*declared host*, and the deployment names *which* host.

### D2 — The conformance rule OD-80 asked to be recorded

**A dependency that is optional to a capability must never be declared in `manifest.json`
`requirements`.** A hard manifest requirement is an all-or-nothing gate for the **entire integration**,
so declaring an optional dependency there converts a degraded capability into a total setup failure.

### D3 — Wyoming is the preferred voice-pipeline interoperability boundary

Where HTBW requires runtime audio, the **Wyoming protocol** is the preferred seam. It is a documented
Open Home Foundation standard, it is natively supported by the Home Assistant `wyoming` integration,
and it is the boundary at which audio exists. This discharges **DL-30** step 2 — an existing maintained
ecosystem capability — rather than inventing an HTBW transport.

**Wyoming is a protocol, not a component.** Wyoming is never called the Voice Identity App, and no
third-party Wyoming project becomes an HTBW dependency.

### D4 — The HTBW Voice Identity App is a runtime host, not a responsibility

The **HTBW Voice Identity App** is the artifact name of the out-of-process runtime that hosts
machine-learning and audio-processing capability. Its **architectural role name is Voice Evidence
Provider Runtime**. It is a **capability component**, never a responsibility, never a platform service,
and never a second identity authority. **DL-05 is unchanged.**

### D5 — The provider reports candidates; Identity resolves the person

A voice provider emits an **unbound Voice Evidence Record** carrying an ordered candidate list with
per-candidate provider-reported scores, separation data, quality metadata, and encoder identity. It
resolves no person, produces no fused confidence, and authorizes nothing. **DL-32**'s rule stands
verbatim: a provider match value is **retained as reported and never rewritten as fused confidence**.

### D6 — Speaker evidence never gates transcription and never travels in transcript text

A non-match, an unknown speaker, an unavailable provider, or an incompatible gallery **never suppresses
the transcript** and **never appears inside transcript content**. Identity is carried on a separate
governed channel.

---

## 5. Architectural scope

| In scope | Out of scope |
|---|---|
| Where a voice-evidence capability executes | Where any other HTBW capability executes — the rule generalises, the instances do not |
| The Wyoming seam and what crosses it | Which speech-to-text engine the household uses |
| The Voice Evidence Provider contract | The Identity Fusion Function — accepted as **DL-38**, unchanged |
| Enrollment channel metadata | Consent capture and revocation experience — **OD-06** |
| Encoder and gallery compatibility | Data residency and local-versus-cloud — **OD-07** |
| Capability availability and degradation | Third-party engines that decide and act — **OD-66** |
| Artifact classes already declared under **DL-43** | New artifact classes — none are created here |

---

## 6. Responsibility boundaries

**No new responsibility is created.** The seven remain seven.

| Owner | Owns |
|---|---|
| **Voice Evidence Provider Runtime** (HTBW Voice Identity App) | Encoder runtime; model loading, pinning, and integrity; audio preprocessing; voice-activity detection where configured; speech-region segmentation; voiceprint generation and comparison; candidate-list generation; provider-reported match values; audio-channel metadata; enrollment-sample processing; capability and health reporting; its own temporary artifacts under a declared lifecycle |
| **Identity** | Person resolution; evidence qualification; combining voice with every other evidence family; Fusion Policy; the four confidence bands; `known` / `ambiguous` / `unknown` / `unavailable` / `not required`; person-specific source reliability; the Identity Assertion; explainability of the identity result; the distinction between a provider score and fused confidence |
| **Operational Trust** | Whether an assertion is sufficient for a requested disclosure or action; whether confirmation is required; whether microphone-derived evidence is permitted for the purpose; audience and disclosure evaluation; the unidentified-person policy |
| **Truth** | Authoritative current-state Facts created from accepted evidence, including the Contextual Person-Presence Fact. **Speech activity detected is not conversation content, and neither is a Person location** |
| **Continuity** | Governed context required to resume, restore, transfer, or continue. **Owns no voiceprint, no recording, no assertion, and no conversation content** |
| **Concierge** | How and when governed assistance is delivered; channel, sequencing, routing, escalation, presentation, confirmation experience, recovery. **Never reinterprets a raw provider match as an Identity Assertion** |

**Two boundary statements are load-bearing.**

- **A provider does not authorize, deny, resolve trust, or select Concierge behaviour.**
- **A detection is never an Identity Assertion** (**DL-06**), and an Identity Assertion is never a
  presence Fact.

---

## Voice Evidence Provider Principle

**Providers produce evidence. HTBW produces decisions.**

| HTBW owns | A provider owns |
|---|---|
| **Identity** — person resolution, evidence qualification, fusion | **Audio processing** — VAD, quality evaluation, segmentation |
| **Confidence** — the four bands, and the distinction between a provider score and fused confidence | **Voiceprint generation** from enrollment audio |
| **Governance** — consent eligibility, retention, explainability, disclosure | **Candidate matching** against a compatible gallery |
| **Person resolution** — which Person, at what support level, for which purpose | **Technical scoring** — provider-reported values and separation data |

**Three consequences follow, and none of them is new.**

1. **A provider's best guess is not an answer.** It is one input to a fusion that also weighs BLE,
   phones, presence trackers, room transitions, and every other configured family, none of which is
   architecturally privileged (**DL-32**).
2. **A provider may be replaced without touching Identity.** If replacing the provider would change
   what HTBW *believes*, the boundary has already been crossed.
3. **A provider's absence is a dependency outcome, not an identity outcome.** The home says *"I cannot
   check your voice right now"*, never *"I do not know who you are"* (**DL-41**, **DL-33**).

**The principle is directional, and the failing direction is the quiet one.** A provider that returns
a person, a band, a threshold verdict, or a permission has not merely exceeded its contract — it has
relocated a governed decision into a component that produces no Decision Trace, consults no consent,
and evaluates no audience.

**Other evidence families — BLE, assigned phones, watches and tablets, companion-app signals, presence
trackers, Wi-Fi associations, room transitions, vehicle associations, and explicit household
enrollment — enter Identity on exactly the same footing.** No source is architecturally privileged
(**DL-32**).

---

## 8. Home Assistant integration role

**The integration stays thin and gracefully degradable.**

| The integration does | The integration does not |
|---|---|
| Configuration, options, and capability enablement | Load a model |
| Register HTBW services and publish governed status | Execute inference |
| Hold the voiceprint gallery and its compatibility metadata | Carry a heavy dependency in `manifest.json` `requirements` |
| Supply correlation context authoritatively | Claim the speech-to-text platform as its purpose |
| Discover App health, version, and capability | Claim the conversation agent |
| Represent capability-unavailable under **DL-41** | Emulate the App when it is absent |

**`requirements` remains empty of optional heavy dependencies.** This is **D2**, and it is the single
conformance rule that would have prevented the verified failure.

**A speech-to-text platform entity is permitted only where the accepted pipeline design requires it,
and never as a way to claim the conversation.** Where a Wyoming placement makes it unnecessary, it is
not created.

---

## 9. HTBW Voice Identity App role

| Property | Statement |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | The declared execution host for voice-evidence capability |
| **Why it exists** | The integration process cannot install or execute the encoder runtime on the target host |
| **What it owns** | Section 6, first row — and nothing else |
| **What it never owns** | Person resolution, fusion, confidence bands, thresholds, trust, policy, permission, delivery, or the transcript |
| **Interface** | A versioned, explicit contract with health and capability discovery |
| **Locality** | Local by default. Residency remains **OD-07** and is not decided here |
| **Absence** | Capability unavailable under **DL-41**, naming the missing dependency in a sentence the household can act on |
| **Naming** | The artifact keeps its released name. The architectural role name is **Voice Evidence Provider Runtime** |

**The App is one instance of a general rule, not the rule.** Another capability may declare a
different host, or none.

---

## 10. Wyoming Protocol role

### Verified protocol facts

Verified 2026-08-25 against the official repository and the Home Assistant integration page.

| Fact | Source |
|---|---|
| Peer-to-peer TCP protocol, JSONL header plus binary payload; MIT; Open Home Foundation | `https://github.com/OHF-Voice/wyoming` |
| Service types advertised in `info`: `asr`, `tts`, `wake`, `handle`, `intent`, `satellite`, `mic`, `snd` | Same |
| Event families: Audio, Info, Speech Recognition, Text to Speech, Wake Word, Voice Activity Detection, Intent Recognition, Intent Handling, Audio Output, Voice Satellite, Timers, Miscellaneous | Same |
| **There is no speaker, identification, verification, or biometric service type, and no speaker-evidence event** | Same |
| `user-event` exists — *"user-defined event"* with `name`, `data`, and `context` | Same |
| `select-program` allows several programs of one type on one endpoint | Same |
| `info.satellite.area` — *"name of area where satellite is located (string, optional)"* | Same |
| `transcribe` and `transcript` each carry an opaque `context` object | Same |
| Home Assistant `wyoming` integration; introduced 2023.5; IoT class Local Push; supports auto-discovery | `https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/wyoming/` |
| **Home Assistant now calls add-ons "apps"** — *"The Wyoming, Piper, and Whisper apps for Home Assistant (formerly known as add-ons)"* | Same |
| Reference app pattern: Docker build published as a Home Assistant app | `https://github.com/rhasspy/wyoming-addons` |
| An official Wyoming **ASR proxy** precedent exists — `stt-fallback` sits in front of Home Assistant speech-to-text entities | Same |

### The documented gap

**Wyoming has no first-class speaker-evidence event.** This is a verified absence, not an assumption.

**HTBW does not invent a protocol extension and does not smuggle identity through transcript text.**
Two conforming options exist, and the choice between them is implementation mapping under this ADR:

| Option | Mechanism | Note |
|---|---|---|
| **W1** | Out-of-band publication — the App reports evidence to the HTBW integration over its own versioned contract, while Wyoming carries only audio and transcript | Preferred. Zero protocol risk; no dependence on an event the protocol does not define |
| **W2** | `user-event` — the sanctioned user-defined event, carrying `name`, `data`, and `context` | Permitted. **Servers are documented to drop unrecognised events**, so this is backward compatible by construction |

**Prohibited regardless of option:** a `[speaker]` transcript prefix, an identity field appended to
`transcript.text`, or any use of transcript content as an identity channel.

**Terminology.** Wyoming is the **protocol**. The App **implements one or more Wyoming-compatible
service roles**. Wyoming is never described as an HTBW component.

---

## 11. Voice Evidence Provider contract

**Conceptual and provider-neutral.** Property names are **implementation mapping**, not architecture,
and must be reconciled against the existing implementation record before they are fixed.

### Runtime production of the record

    end

    G --> CARRIES
    G -.->|excluded by construction| NEVER
```

### Elements the contract must be able to represent

| Group | Elements |
|---|---|
| Identity of the record | `evidence_id`; provider identifier; provider version |
| Source | Source device; source room where available; pipeline correlation information **where legitimately available** |
| Time | Observation timestamp; expiry timestamp |
| Encoder identity | Encoder family; encoder version; audio-contract version |
| Audio | Audio-quality measures; speech-region metadata; channel metadata |
| Result | **Ordered candidate list** with a provider-reported score per candidate; winner-to-runner-up separation; ambiguity indicators |
| Health | Processing metadata; processing warnings; provider capability status |
| Outcomes | No-match; unavailable; incompatible |

### What the contract must never claim

Final person resolution · fused confidence · a confidence band · a threshold verdict · authorization ·
permission · a Trust outcome · a Concierge outcome.

### Reconciliation with the existing implementation record

| Existing artifact | Alignment | Required change |
|---|---|---|
| `SpeakerEvidenceRecord` — unbound, `slots=True`, explicitly excludes `conversation_id`, `device_id`, `room_id`, `satellite_id`, `pipeline_id`, audio, transcript, embeddings, voiceprints | **Correct and preserved.** This is the correlation boundary implemented properly | Extend to carry an **ordered candidate list and separation data** in place of a single `speaker_candidate` |
| `ComparisonResult` — `known_matches`, `best_match`, `second_best_match`, `is_ambiguous` | Top-N and ambiguity already computed internally | **Publish** it. Today the candidate list exists but does not cross the boundary |
| `encoder_family`, `encoder_version`, `audio_contract_version` persisted and enforced before comparison | **Correct and preserved.** Stronger than any third-party project reviewed | None |
| `ConfidenceBand = unavailable \| unknown \| no_match \| low \| medium \| high \| ambiguous` | **Conflicts with DL-39.** Collapses state and band into one enum, uses `medium` rather than `Moderate`, and has no `Very High` | Provider must emit **no band at all**. Bands are Identity's output, produced by **DL-38** |
| `AttributionResult.attributed_person_id`, `is_confident` | **Conflicts with DL-06 and DL-32.** A provider resolving a person | Provider reports candidates; Identity resolves |
| A single default confidence threshold constant | **Conflicts with DL-36** — *"sufficiency is never universal"* | Thresholds are Fusion Policy configuration and Operational Trust requirements, never a provider constant |

**These are boundary corrections, not defects of ambition.** The implementation is ahead of every
third-party project reviewed on encoder pinning and correlation discipline.

---

## 12. Enrollment architecture

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    START["Household begins enrollment<br/>consent recorded first"] --> CH{"Capture channel"}
    CH -->|"Voice satellite"| S1["Capture through the satellite<br/>that will serve at runtime"]
    CH -->|"Browser or companion app"| S2["Capture through the interaction surface"]
    S1 --> META
    S2 --> META
    META["Record channel metadata:<br/>satellite identity · microphone or device identity · room ·<br/>capture distance · prompt category · environmental condition ·<br/>noise condition · sample quality · audio format ·<br/>encoder identity · audio-contract version"]
    META --> GATE{"Quality and diversity gates met?"}
    GATE -->|No| MORE["Request further samples<br/>naming what is missing"]
    MORE --> CH
    GATE -->|Yes| BUILD["App derives the voiceprint"]
    BUILD --> PIN["Persist with encoder family,<br/>encoder version, audio-contract version"]
    PIN --> DONE["Voiceprint active in the gallery"]
    PIN --> CLEAN["Enrollment samples removed<br/>DL-43: temporary, zero default retention"]
```

**Channel-aware enrollment is adopted.** A voiceprint recorded on a phone is not equally
representative of audio captured by a distant room satellite, and the reference implementation already
captures `capture_distance` and `prompt_category`. **Microphone and satellite identity are added as
diversity axes.**

**One question is deliberately not answered here.** Whether HTBW uses one person-global gallery with
channel diversity, per-channel derived profiles, or a hybrid is **not decided by this ADR**. The
repository has not decided it. It is recorded in section 28 as a residual and must not be chosen
silently.

**Artifact lifecycle is already accepted and is not re-decided.** **DL-43** states it: enrollment
samples are Identity-owned, **temporary with zero default retention**, removed on success, on
cancellation, on failure cleanup, on consent withdrawal, or on policy expiry, and **never become
historical identity evidence merely because they existed**; voiceprints are retained while the profile
remains enabled **and consent remains valid**, and are deleted on profile removal or consent
withdrawal.

---

## 13. Runtime matching architecture

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant SAT as Voice satellite
    participant HA as Assist pipeline
    participant APP as HTBW Voice Identity App
    participant STT as Speech-to-text backend
    participant INT as HTBW integration
    participant ID as Identity

    SAT->>HA: wake word detected, audio streams
    HA->>APP: audio-start / audio-chunk (Wyoming)
    APP->>APP: VAD, quality evaluation, speech-region segmentation
    APP->>APP: embed regions, compare against compatible gallery
    HA->>APP: audio-stop
    APP->>STT: audio forwarded — always
    STT-->>APP: transcript
    APP-->>HA: transcript — unmodified, no speaker prefix
    APP->>INT: Unbound Voice Evidence Record (out of band)
    INT->>ID: evidence + Concierge-supplied correlation context
    ID->>ID: qualification, then Fusion Policy (DL-38)
    ID-->>INT: Identity Assertion — known / ambiguous / unknown / unavailable / not required
```

**The transcript path and the evidence path are independent.** Failure on the evidence path degrades
identity, never speech.

### Speech-region segmentation

**Adopted as an App capability for controlled experimentation.** Detect speech regions, evaluate each
separately, generate evidence from relevant regions, and preserve competing-speaker and noisy-audio
conditions as **quality metadata**.

**Region-level matching is an App capability and never an Identity decision.** A provider may not
convert a non-match into a silent authorization denial.

---

## 14. STT relationship

| Rule | Statement |
|---|---|
| **Transcription always proceeds** | A non-match, an unknown speaker, an unavailable App, or an incompatible gallery never suppresses the transcript |
| **Comparison is enrichment-only** | Speaker evidence never blocks, delays past its budget, or alters the meaning of a transcript |
| **No identity in transcript content** | No prefix, no suffix, no appended field |
| **Downstream STT behaviour is unchanged** | The configured backend receives audio it can transcribe and behaves exactly as it does without HTBW present |
| **HTBW does not become the household's speech-to-text engine** | It may sit in front of one; it never replaces one |
| **HTBW does not claim the conversation agent** | Conversation remains Home Assistant's, or Concierge's, under their own boundaries |

---

## 15. Correlation boundary

**The correlation boundary is already settled in the reference implementation and this ADR preserves
it verbatim.**

Home Assistant's `SpeechMetadata` carries `{language, format, codec, bit_rate, sample_rate, channel}`
and **no correlation identifiers**. A speech-to-text provider's audio-stream entry point never receives
`conversation_id`, `device_id`, `satellite_id`, or `pipeline_id`.

**Wyoming does not close this gap.** Verified: `info.satellite.area` carries an area **name**, not a
stable `area_id`, and **DL-31** requires reference by stable identifier. The `context` object on
`transcribe` and `transcript` is opaque interaction context, not pipeline correlation.

| Rule | Statement |
|---|---|
| Evidence is produced **unbound** | The App emits evidence with no correlation identifiers, by construction |
| **Concierge is the sole authoritative source of correlation context** | Supplied explicitly on the identity request |
| Binding happens **later**, in HTBW | The authoritative binder is the HTBW integration acting for Identity, never the provider |
| **Recency-only matching is prohibited** | Device plus timing proximity is never an authoritative correlation method. **DL-35** already states that temporal proximity alone never establishes correlation |
| **A satellite area name is not a Room** | It may be recorded as provider metadata; it never resolves a Room by itself |
| Unresolvable correlation is **reported, never guessed** | The evidence remains unbound and is not consumed as though it were bound |

**Remaining contract work is tracked as an issue, not invented here.**

---

## 16. Encoder and gallery compatibility

**Preserved and formalised. This is the strongest property of the current implementation and no
third-party project reviewed has it.**

| Rule | Statement |
|---|---|
| Encoder family is recorded | On every voiceprint and every evidence record |
| Encoder version is recorded | Same |
| Audio-contract version is recorded | Same |
| Compatibility is **enforced before comparison** | Not warned about afterwards |
| An incompatible gallery produces an **explicit outcome** | A capability or compatibility outcome under **DL-41** — *configured but invalid* is already an enumerated dependency state |
| **No README warning stands in for an invariant** | *"You must re-enroll after changing models"* is not a control |
| Model upgrade requires a **governed migration path** | Rebuild, re-derive, or re-enroll — declared before the upgrade, never discovered after it |
| Runtime identity is derived from the **resolved runtime encoder** | Not from a static pinned constant, which can falsely exclude a compatible candidate |

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    REQ["Comparison requested"] --> RESOLVE["Resolve runtime encoder identity<br/>family · version · audio-contract"]
    RESOLVE --> ENUM["Enumerate active voiceprints"]

    CMP --> OUT["Unbound Voice Evidence Record"]
    INCOMPAT --> OUT2["Evidence record carrying the incompatible outcome"]
```

**An incompatible gallery is a dependency outcome, never an identity failure and never a trust
failure** (**DL-41**).

**This diagram depicts DL-38 and DL-39 as already accepted. It adds nothing to them.**

| Outcome | Meaning | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `known` | Leading candidate reaches the purpose minimum **and** satisfies the separation requirement | Carries one of **Low < Moderate < High < Very High** (**DL-39**) |
| `ambiguous` | Candidates too close to separate | **Carries no band.** Never resolved by picking the leader |
| `unknown` | A provider evaluated successfully and returned no eligible match | **Never reported as `unavailable`** (**DL-33**). Carries whether a human participant is supported, so *"someone is here and I do not know who"* stays distinguishable |
| `unavailable` | The provider, host, or dependency could not evaluate | A **DL-41** dependency outcome |
| `not required` | No known-Person identity is required for this operation | **Never an absence of governance** |

**An Unknown Person creates no Home Assistant Person, owns no preferences, inherits nothing, generates
no person-scoped learning, and grants nothing** (**DL-33**). What an unidentified person may request is
the **unidentified-person policy**, owned by Operational Trust.

### Ambiguity is not plurality

**`ambiguous` means one speaker whose identity could not be separated between candidates. It does not
mean two people spoke.** A top-N candidate list expresses **uncertainty about one voice**, never
**plurality of voices**, and the two produce the same shape — several candidates scoring closely —
from opposite causes.

**HTBW already represents plurality in two places and in neither of them is it a speaker.** **DL-35**
makes *"one actor, several actors, and unresolved plurality"* representable for an **Unknown Actor
Reference** in a historical reconstruction. [../models/communication.md](../models/communication.md)
carries *Multiple known Persons* and *Unresolved plurality* as **audience composition** states — and
**DL-34** is explicit that audience composition *"identifies nobody"* and *"is never a second identity
fusion"*, so it cannot be borrowed here. **Audience answers who could hear. This question is who
spoke.**

**Whether an evidence record may report more than one speaker is OD-84, and it is not decided here.**
Until it is, an implementation **must not report plurality as `ambiguous`**, and a second speaker's
presence in a capture remains **quality metadata** under section 13 rather than a second candidate in
the list.

## 18. Capability availability and degradation

    E1 --> ID

```

**Four rules bind.**

1. **HTBW does not emulate a missing dependency** — no approximation, no local stand-in, no silent
   reduction to something weaker sharing the same name (**DL-41**).
2. **Capability unavailable is never expressed as a trust failure, an identity failure, or a permission
   failure** (**DL-41**).
3. **Absence is neutral in fusion** — fewer sources lower the ceiling; they never impose a penalty and
   never create a denominator effect (**DL-38 F7**).
4. **A consent-excluded source is excluded before weighting**, not down-weighted (**DL-38**).

---

## 19. Privacy and local-first requirements

| Rule | Authority |
|---|---|
| Local-by-default execution; **cloud voiceprint generation is not the default architecture** | This ADR; residency remains **OD-07** |
| **Safe metadata only** leaves the provider — never vectors, embeddings, or storage paths | `privacy.md` |
| Raw audio is **transient** at the provider and is not persisted by default | **DL-43** |
| Voiceprints and enrollment samples are **internal runtime artifacts** and are **not exposed as resident media** | **DL-44** |
| Numeric provider scores are **not rendered to the household** | `privacy.md`; **DL-39** bands are the household-facing currency |
| Consent is **scoped** — consenting to voice identity is not consent to anything else | `person-and-identity.md`; capture experience is **OD-06** |
| **A required control that silently does not apply is a silent reduction and is prohibited** | **DL-41** — enforce it, or report it unmet |

---

## 20. Artifact lifecycle and retention

**No new artifact class is created.** Every artifact this architecture produces already has an accepted
**DL-43** declaration:

| Artifact | Owner | Retention |
|---|---|---|
| Voice enrollment samples | Identity | Temporary, **zero default retention** |
| Voiceprints and derived profiles | Identity | While the profile is enabled **and consent remains valid** |
| Voice Evidence Records | Identity | Retained **with the Decision Trace or governed history they support** — never under a separate universal duration, and never as a licence to retain biometric internals (**DL-47**) |
| App temporary processing artifacts | Voice Evidence Provider Runtime | Transient; declared before introduction (**DL-43**) |

### Rejected-audio retention

**Not enabled by default. Not enabled without governance.**

A near-miss telemetry loop is architecturally useful — top candidates, separation margin, audio-quality
measures, near-match reason, channel, region, processing duration, encoder-compatibility result — and
**all of that is metadata, not audio**.

**Retaining the raw rejected audio is a different thing entirely.** Rejected audio is, by definition,
disproportionately the audio of **guests, visitors, children, and unenrolled people** — those least
able to consent. If it is ever proposed, it requires, before creation and not after: explicit
configuration; a declared purpose; a retention duration; access controls; deletion behaviour; a consent
and privacy review; and a **DL-43** artifact declaration. **An unbounded default is prohibited.**

---

## 21. Security model

| Rule | Statement |
|---|---|
| The App interface is **authenticated** | An unauthenticated inference endpoint is an unauthenticated biometric endpoint |
| The App is **not a public surface** | It is reached by the HTBW integration, not by household automations |
| **A public surface is never an authority bypass** | Operational Trust evaluates appropriateness before any effect, regardless of who invoked it. Whether HTBW publishes public capability surfaces at all is **OD-81** |
| Model artifacts are **integrity-verified** | Pinned digest, validated on load |
| **HTBW acquires no host operating-system administration** | Consistent with the existing storage boundary (**DL-44**) |
| Provider timeouts are **bounded** and produce `unavailable` | Never an indefinite wait, never a silent success |
| Malformed evidence is **rejected**, never partially consumed | A partial biometric record is not a weaker record; it is an invalid one |

---

## 22. Provenance and open-source research

**No third-party source code is adopted.** Everything below is architectural knowledge, an API-contract
idea, or an algorithmic approach — reimplemented as HTBW-owned contracts.

| Source | License | Pattern taken | Classification | Attribution required |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `OHF-Voice/wyoming` | MIT | Protocol facts; `user-event` as the sanctioned extension point; `select-program`; `info` service-type set | Published protocol specification | Cited as the standard |
| `rhasspy/wyoming-addons` | MIT | Docker-build-to-Home-Assistant-app packaging; the `stt-fallback` ASR-proxy precedent | General architectural knowledge | Cited as precedent |
| Home Assistant `wyoming` integration | Apache-2.0 | Native transport availability; auto-discovery; **"apps (formerly known as add-ons)"** terminology | Platform documentation | Cited as platform fact |
| `EuleMitKeule/speaker-recognition` | MIT | App-plus-thin-client packaging shape; a REST evidence contract distinct from the pipeline | Architectural knowledge | Cited; no code taken |
| `ExhaleSthlm/speaker-id` | MIT | **Top-N candidate response** with per-candidate scores; centroid rebuild as an explicit operation | API-contract idea | Cited; no code taken |
| `jxlarrea/wyoming-voice-match` | MIT | Speech-region segmentation with per-region scoring; **channel-matched enrollment**; separation-margin telemetry | Algorithmic approach | Cited; no code taken |
| `cybericebyte/VoiceBM` | MIT | Continuous passive evidence accrual into a shared gallery — **concept only** | Architectural knowledge | Cited; no code taken |

**Rules that bind any future adoption.**

1. No source code is introduced without an explicit license and attribution review.
2. HTBW implements **HTBW-owned contracts and provider interfaces informed by** the research.
3. **No single-maintainer external project becomes a mandatory HTBW dependency** without separate
   governance approval. Every project above has exactly one contributor.
4. Model licences are pinned and recorded alongside the encoder version.

## 23. Adopted external patterns

| # | Pattern | Adopted as |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Out-of-process machine-learning runtime | **D1**, **D2** |
| 2 | Wyoming-compatible voice-pipeline participation | **D3**, section 10 |
| 3 | Thin integration plus App | Section 8 |
| 4 | Top-N candidate contract | **D5**, section 11 |
| 5 | Encoder and gallery compatibility | Section 16 — **already HTBW's, formalised** |
| 6 | Channel-aware enrollment | Section 12 |
| 7 | Speech-region segmentation | Section 13 — App capability, never an Identity decision |
| 8 | Speaker-conditioned audio extraction | Section 24 — **validation-required, not accepted behaviour** |
| 9 | Rejection and near-match telemetry | Section 20 — metadata adopted, raw audio not |
| 10 | Passive voice evidence and conversation-active | Section 25 — **North Star only** |

The eight patterns HTBW **accepts and intends to adopt**, with their provenance, are stated below.

---

## Harvested Architecture Patterns

**Accepted implementation patterns.** Each is adopted **where appropriate**, reimplemented as an
HTBW-owned contract. **No third-party source code is taken**, every source is MIT-licensed, and the
provenance rules in section 22 bind each one.

### Pattern 1 — Out-of-process runtime

**Source:** `EuleMitKeule/speaker-recognition`, `ExhaleSthlm/speaker-id`, `cybericebyte/VoiceBM`,
`jxlarrea/wyoming-voice-match` — four independent projects, converging.

**Decision.** Machine-learning runtimes **execute outside Home Assistant Core**. The Home Assistant
integration remains **dependency-light**. The **HTBW Voice Identity App is the preferred runtime
host**.

**Bound by.** **D1** — the host is a declared, per-capability **DL-41** dependency, so *preferred* is
not *mandatory* and no deployment topology is required by the architecture (**P25**). **D2** — an
optional dependency is never a manifest `requirements` entry.

### Pattern 2 — Wyoming-compatible participation

**Source:** the Wyoming protocol architecture.

**Decision.** The HTBW Voice Identity App **participates naturally in the Home Assistant voice
pipeline**. **Wyoming is adopted as a protocol boundary, not a product dependency.**

**Bound by.** Wyoming is never called an HTBW component. No third-party Wyoming project becomes a
runtime dependency. The protocol defines **no speaker-evidence event**, so evidence leaves by the
governed channel of section 10 — **never inside transcript text**.

### Pattern 3 — Top-N candidate evidence

**Source:** `ExhaleSthlm/speaker-id`.

**Decision.** Voice evidence providers return **ordered candidate sets rather than a single winner**.
**Identity is responsible for ambiguity handling and person resolution.**

**Bound by.** **DL-38 F8** — `known` requires the leading candidate to reach the purpose minimum *and*
satisfy a governed separation requirement. **A single winner gives fusion nothing to evaluate
separation against**, which is why this is a correction and not an enhancement.

### Pattern 4 — Channel-aware enrollment

**Source:** `jxlarrea/wyoming-voice-match`.

**Decision.** Enrollment metadata captures **microphone source, satellite source, room, capture
distance, and audio characteristics**. **A voiceprint records where enrollment occurred.**

**Bound by.** Recording where enrollment occurred is **not** the same as deciding how the gallery is
structured. That question — one person-global gallery with channel diversity, per-channel derived
profiles, or a hybrid — is **OD-83**, and it must not be settled by implementation choice.

### Pattern 5 — Speech-region segmentation

**Source:** `jxlarrea/wyoming-voice-match`.

**Decision.** **Region-level analysis is an approved implementation strategy** for Voice Identity
matching.

**Bound by.** Region-level matching is an **App capability and never an Identity decision**.
Competing-speaker and noisy-audio conditions are preserved as **quality metadata**. A provider may
never convert a non-match into a silent authorization denial (**D6**).

### Pattern 6 — Rejection telemetry

**Source:** `jxlarrea/wyoming-voice-match`.

**Decision.** **Near-match data, separation margins, and ambiguity information may be retained as
governed evidence.** **Raw audio retention remains opt-in.**

**Bound by.** Retained telemetry is a **governed record class** and therefore declares its retention
before it exists (**DL-47**) — it follows the Voice Evidence Record rule, retained **with the Decision
Trace or governed history it supports**, never under a separate universal duration and never as a
licence to retain biometric internals. **Opt-in is not a checkbox**: raw audio requires, before
creation, explicit configuration, a declared purpose, a retention duration, access controls, deletion
behaviour, a consent and privacy review, and a **DL-43** artifact declaration (section 20). Rejected
audio is disproportionately that of guests, visitors, children, and unenrolled people.

### Pattern 7 — Provider abstraction

**Source:** research findings across all four projects.

**Decision.** HTBW consumes **Voice Evidence Providers**. **Identity must never depend on a single
provider implementation.**

**Bound by.** The Voice Evidence Provider Principle above. Every project reviewed has exactly one
contributor, and two are effectively unmaintained — the abstraction exists so that **no maintainer
becomes load-bearing**.

### Pattern 8 — Passive conversation-state North Star

**Source:** VoiceBM concepts, and HTBW Concierge discussion.

**Classification: North Star capability only. Not accepted production functionality.**

Future exploration may include **speech activity**, **conversation active**, and **possible
participants** — **without** transcript generation, conversation storage, or semantic analysis.

**No implementation is authorized by this ADR.** Section 25 holds the gate: privacy review, retention
controls, microphone-governance policy, audience and disclosure review (**DL-34**), Truth
representation (**OD-74**, and **DL-39** bands may not be borrowed), and Concierge consumption design.

---

## 24. Speaker-conditioned audio extraction — validation required

**Classification: candidate capability. Not accepted production behaviour.**

The intended outcome is to improve the audio passed to speech-to-text when a television, radio, ambient
speech, or another person contaminates the microphone stream, keeping the operation local and
preserving every Identity and Trust boundary.

**It may not become accepted behaviour without all of:** technical validation; privacy review; quality
testing; unknown-person behaviour testing; transcript-integrity testing; and failure-mode analysis.

**One risk is specific and must be tested for directly.** Extraction **modifies the audio a household
member's words are transcribed from**. A false rejection of a legitimate speech region silently deletes
part of what a person said — which is a transcript-integrity failure that presents as a
speech-recognition error. **This is the mechanism by which "enrichment-only" could quietly stop being
true**, and it is why extraction is classified separately from every other pattern in section 23.

---

## 25. North Star — passive voice evidence and conversation-active

**Classification: North Star capability. Not current production behaviour. Not implemented. Not
approved.**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    MIC["Room audio — VAD only"] --> ACT{"Speech activity detected?"}
    ACT -->|No| IDLE["No signal"]
    ACT -->|Yes| SIG["Minimum-necessary output:<br/>conversation_active · speech_activity_start ·<br/>speech_activity_end · possible participant candidates ·<br/>provider score · room or audio-source context<br/><br/>content_processed = false<br/>transcript_created = false<br/>transcript_retained = false"]
    SIG --> TRUTH["Truth — speech activity as a Fact"]
    SIG --> IDCAND["Identity — participant candidates as evidence"]
    TRUTH --> CONC["Concierge — channel and timing decision"]
    IDCAND --> CONC
    CONC --> ROUTE["An important message arrives.<br/>Speech activity is detected in the Room.<br/>The message is delivered privately to the person's phone."]
    ROUTE --> AFTER["When speech activity ends, the Room assistant may say<br/>an important update was sent."]
```

**The point of the capability is what it does not do.** The home does not transcribe, interpret, or
retain the conversation. **Detected speech activity is not captured conversation content**, and that
distinction is Truth's to hold.

### Concierge channel routing under the North Star

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant ST as Stewardship
    participant CM as Communication origination
    participant TR as Truth
    participant OT as Operational Trust
    participant CO as Concierge
    participant PH as Person's phone
    participant RM as Room assistant

    ST->>CM: an obligation raises something that must be conveyed
    CM->>OT: significance and intended recipient
    TR-->>OT: conversation_active true in this Room, content_processed false
    OT->>OT: audience composition — who could perceive a Room delivery?
    OT-->>CO: private delivery permitted, Room delivery not appropriate now
    CO->>PH: deliver privately to the intended person
    Note over CO,RM: Concierge chooses surface, moment and form.<br/>It sets no threshold.
    TR-->>CO: speech_activity_end
    CO->>RM: may state that an important update was sent
    Note over RM: The content is not repeated aloud.<br/>No transcript was created or retained.
```

**Read the boundaries off the diagram.** Stewardship originates and never acts. Truth reports speech
activity and never content. Operational Trust evaluates audience and entitlement. Concierge chooses
channel, sequencing, and moment, and **sets no threshold** (**DL-36**). **Permission to act does not
imply permission to announce** (**DL-29**), which is why the **delivery** degrades and the governance
does not.

**Required before any implementation:** privacy review; retention controls; microphone-governance
policy; audience and disclosure review (**DL-34**); Truth representation (**OD-74** for Fact confidence,
which **may not borrow DL-39 bands**); and Concierge consumption design. **Continuous ambient
transcription is prohibited as the mechanism** — see section 26.

---

## 26. Rejected external patterns

**Recorded so that they are rejected once, explicitly, rather than re-argued.**

| # | Rejected pattern | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Identity embedded in transcript text | An identity assertion in a content field is logged, recorded, and passed to reasoning providers with **no audience evaluation** (**DL-34**) |
| 2 | Transcript prefixes such as `[Tom]` | Same, plus it breaks native intent matching |
| 3 | Provider match used directly as fused Identity confidence | **DL-32** — retained as reported, never rewritten |
| 4 | Provider match used directly as authorization | **DL-36** — Operational Trust owns every threshold |
| 5 | A non-match automatically suppressing speech-to-text | Removes `unknown` as an expressible outcome (**DL-33**) |
| 6 | Unknown speakers converted into empty transcripts | Same |
| 7 | A voice provider owning Trust policy | **DL-14** |
| 8 | A voice provider owning Concierge behaviour | Concierge contract |
| 9 | Unbounded raw rejected-audio retention | **DL-43**; privacy; disproportionately captures those least able to consent |
| 10 | An external stateful vector store as a required household dependency | **DL-30** burden undischarged; **DL-42**; a household gallery is single-digit records |
| 11 | Hard dependency on one community repository or maintainer | Section 22, rule 3 |
| 12 | Model changes that silently invalidate stored voiceprints | Section 16 |
| 13 | Ambient transcript creation as the default conversation-state mechanism | Section 25; **P27** minimisation; **DL-34** |
| 14 | Cloud voiceprint generation as the default architecture | Section 19; residency remains **OD-07** |

---

## 27. Consequences

### Positive

- **OD-80's verified failure cannot recur** once **D2** is applied.
- Speaker evidence becomes **fusable** — a candidate list with separation data is what **DL-38** F8
  actually needs, and a single winner is not.
- HTBW gains access to runtime audio **without owning speech-to-text or the conversation**.
- The provider boundary becomes **swappable**, so no maintainer or project becomes load-bearing.
- Enrollment quality improves in the dimension that actually fails in deployment — the channel.

### Negative, and accepted

- **Availability becomes deployment-dependent.** Apps exist only on some Home Assistant installation
  types. This is stated by OD-80 itself and is the honest cost of alternative (B) as a reference
  deployment. **D1** limits the damage by making the host declared rather than assumed.
- **Two artifacts must be released and version-matched.** Version-skew becomes a real failure mode and
  is why capability discovery is mandatory rather than optional.
- **A proxy placement adds a hop** in the audio path. Latency budgets become a contract concern.
- **The correlation gap is not closed by Wyoming**, only preserved honestly. Binding still requires
  Concierge-supplied context.

### Neutral

- No responsibility is created, moved, split, or renamed.
- No accepted decision is reopened.
- No production code is changed by this ADR.

---

## 28. Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| **Extraction silently truncates legitimate speech** | High | Section 24 — validation gate; extraction is classified separately and is not accepted behaviour |
| **The App becomes a second identity authority by drift** | High | Section 6; the contract forbids person resolution, bands, and thresholds at the provider |
| **Band vocabulary drift** — provider bands re-entering as Identity bands | Medium | Section 11 — the provider emits no band at all |
| Version skew between integration and App | Medium | Mandatory capability and version discovery; incompatible produces `unavailable` |
| A single-maintainer upstream project becomes load-bearing | Medium | Section 22, rule 3 |
| Model licence drift | Medium | Licence pinned with the encoder version |
| Near-miss telemetry grows into an audio archive | Medium | Section 20 — metadata adopted, raw audio gated |
| **Gallery-versus-channel question decided silently** | Medium | Recorded as a residual below; must not be chosen by implementation |
| Latency regression in the voice pipeline | Low | Bounded provider budget; timeout yields `unavailable`, never a stalled pipeline |

### Residuals not decided by this ADR

**Gallery structure under channel diversity** — one person-global gallery with channel diversity,
per-channel derived profiles, or a hybrid. **Recorded as OD-83** rather than settled by implementation
choice. Pattern 4 decides that a voiceprint **records where enrollment occurred**; it does not decide
how the gallery is **structured**, and the two must not be conflated.

**Speaker plurality** — whether an evidence record may report that **more than one person spoke**.
**Recorded as OD-84.** See section 17: **ambiguity is not plurality**, and an implementation must not
report one as the other.

**Two questions were tested against the harvest and deliberately answered *no*.** A separate
`voice-evidence-provider-contract.md` is **not** created, because
[../contracts/README.md](../contracts/README.md) defines a contract as *"the explicit boundary of a
responsibility"* describing *"obligations between responsibilities, not transport, schema, or platform
mechanics"* — and **a provider is a component, not a responsibility**. The provider boundary belongs
in [../contracts/identity-contract.md](../contracts/identity-contract.md), where it now is. A
**provider plug-in or registry framework** is likewise **not** created: **DL-41** already enumerates
*a provider* as a dependency class, and building a registration framework would be a new HTBW
capability requiring the **DL-30** burden to be discharged first.

---

## 29. Alternatives considered

| Alternative | Verdict |
|---|---|
| **(A)** Refuse an execution host; leave such capability permanently unavailable | **Rejected.** A large capability loss taken by omission, and the household is given no path |
| **(B)** A Home Assistant app as *the* governed execution host | **Rejected as the architecture, adopted as the reference deployment.** Binding HTBW to one deployment topology contradicts **P25** |
| **(C)** A household-provided external service or device referenced like any other provider | **Not rejected — permitted under D1**, and it engages **OD-07** and consent. Not the reference deployment |
| **(D)** A per-capability declared host, named in the dependency declaration and the Decision Trace | **Adopted.** The most explainable and the most to specify, which is the correct trade for a constitutional rule |
| **(E)** Native-only; bound capability ambition to what the environment can install | **Rejected.** Would have removed voice evidence entirely on the verified host |
| Consume a third-party speaker-recognition project as a runtime dependency | **Rejected.** All four reviewed have one contributor; two are effectively unmaintained; adopting their integration layers would import competing STT and conversation ownership |
| Extend the Wyoming protocol with a new first-class speaker event | **Deferred, not rejected.** Section 10 records the gap; `user-event` already provides a backward-compatible path, and proposing a protocol change is a separate conversation with the Open Home Foundation |
| Carry identity in the transcript because it solves correlation for free | **Rejected.** Section 26, rows 1 and 2 |

---

## 30. Migration from the current implementation

**No production code is changed by this ADR.** This is the target-state migration description.

| # | Question | Position |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Which integration modules remain | Voiceprint registry and storage; compatibility enforcement; candidate provider; services; config and options; health and diagnostics projection; evidence publication |
| 2 | Which modules move to the App | Encoder runtime; model loading, download, and integrity validation; feature extraction; audio preprocessing; VAD; segmentation; embedding. **Already done** — an accepted implementation-repository ADR created a Debian-based app with `GET /health` and `POST /embed` |
| 3 | Which provisional implementations retire | The deterministic development encoder as a runtime path; any single-winner evidence shape; any provider-emitted confidence band; any universal confidence-threshold constant |
| 4 | How existing voiceprints are handled | Records carrying full encoder metadata are retained. Legacy all-`None` records **fail closed** and are re-enrolled |
| 5 | How encoder identity is preserved | Unchanged — the three-field invariant already exists and is enforced at persistence |
| 6 | Is re-enrollment required | **Only for legacy records without encoder metadata**, and for a governed model upgrade. Not otherwise |
| 7 | How configuration migrates | Host declaration is added as a capability dependency. Existing options are preserved |
| 8 | How provider health is exposed | Capability and version discovery, projected as governed status. **Never as a numeric score** |
| 9 | How unavailable capability is represented | Section 18 — a **DL-41** dependency outcome naming the missing dependency |
| 10 | How standalone product naming is removed from the surface while the responsibility remains | **This is not decided here.** The responsibility is Identity (**DL-05**) and the artifact keeps its released name. The product-consolidation question is raised as **OD-82** — see section 32 |
| 11 | How legacy coupling is eliminated | The consumer supplies correlation context explicitly and consumes evidence through the contract. No consumer reinterprets a raw provider match |
| 12 | How tests divide | Section 31 |

**One reconciliation is required and is recorded honestly.** The implementation-repository ADR
`ADR_PRODUCTION_INFERENCE_HOSTING_MODEL.md` (Accepted, 2026-07-30) **rejected Wyoming** on the grounds
that *"the ECAPA embedding service does not fit the Wyoming audio-stream model. The simpler HTTP API is
a better fit."*

**That judgement was correct for the seam it evaluated and does not conflict with D3.** It evaluated
Wyoming as the transport for a **one-shot embedding microservice**, where HTTP is indeed the better
fit. **D3 adopts Wyoming at a different seam** — the streaming audio path, where the embedding service
is not the thing being exposed. Both hold simultaneously: **HTTP internally for inference, Wyoming
externally for audio access.** Under the authority order that ADR is rank 5 evidence and does not bind
this repository, but it is not overridden here — it is scoped.

## 31. Implementation phases

**Not implemented by this ADR.** Recorded as the roadmap.

| Phase | Scope |
|---|---|
| **1 — Architecture and contracts** | This ADR accepted; Voice Evidence Provider contract; App-and-integration responsibility boundary; capability discovery contract, **including optional-feature discovery so a provider declares which of segmentation, extraction, and passive capture it supports**; **provider-substitution migration**, which is the model-upgrade rule of section 16 applied to a change of provider rather than of model; retention classification |
| **2 — App runtime foundation** | Supported encoder runtime; model loading; health; version reporting; local artifact storage; API authentication; capability reporting |
| **3 — Enrollment** | Wyoming or satellite capture path; channel metadata; quality gates; voiceprint creation; gallery compatibility; re-enrollment and migration |
| **4 — Runtime matching** | Pre-STT audio access; top-N candidate result; separation data; ambiguous and no-match outcomes; unbound evidence publication |
| **5 — Wyoming pipeline integration** | Proxy or service placement; unchanged downstream STT behaviour; no transcript prefixing; no transcript blocking by default; correlation validation |
| **6 — Advanced audio processing** | Speech-region segmentation; speaker-conditioned extraction experiment; noise and television testing; multi-speaker testing |
| **7 — North Star conversation-state evidence** | Passive VAD feasibility; minimum-necessary participant evidence; privacy and retention controls; Truth representation; Concierge channel-selection consumption |

### Where each harvested pattern lands

| Pattern | Phase | Issue |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — Out-of-process runtime | 2 | #162 |
| 2 — Wyoming-compatible participation | 5 | #165 |
| 3 — **Top-N provider contract** | 1 (contract), 4 (published) | #161, #164 |
| 4 — **Channel-aware enrollment** | 3 | #163 |
| 5 — **Speech-region processing** | 6 | #166 |
| 6 — Rejection telemetry | 6 | #166 |
| 7 — Provider abstraction | 1 | #161 |
| 8 — **Conversation-state research** | 7 | #167 |
| — **Speaker-conditioned extraction evaluation** | 6, **validation-gated** | #166 |

**Two phases are not authorisations.** Phase 6 carries the section 24 validation gate; Phase 7 is
North Star research and this ADR approves no implementation of it.

### Testing strategy

**Home Assistant is not installed for this work.** Deterministic fixtures reproduce results without
live biometric hardware — which is already an accepted Identity guarantee.

**Household validation is eyes-and-ears from the Home Assistant environment**, using the existing
repository deploy script when implementation begins.

### Open decisions

| ID | Issue | Relationship |
|---|---|---|
| **OD-80** | **#153** | **Resolved by this ADR as DL-50** |
| **OD-82** | **#160** | **Raised by this ADR.** Product consolidation and retirement — see below |
| **OD-83** | **#168** | **Raised on acceptance.** Voiceprint gallery structure under channel diversity — see §28 |
| **OD-84** | **#169** | **Raised by the post-acceptance harvest.** Multi-speaker evidence and speaker plurality — see §17 |
| **OD-07** | #95 | Voice processing locality. **Engaged, not resolved** |
| **OD-06** | #94 | Consent capture and revocation. **Engaged, not resolved** |
| **OD-15** | #96 | Assertion lifetime. Untouched |
| **OD-66** | #131 | Delegation boundary. The App is **HTBW's own capability**, not a third-party engine that decides and acts — distinct, and not preempted |
| **OD-67** | #132 | Reasoning provider strategy. A speech-to-text provider **must not be merged** with a reasoning provider |
| **OD-74** | #93 | Truth Fact confidence. Relevant to section 25. **DL-39 bands may not be borrowed** |
| **OD-81** | #159 | Capability exposure and self-consumption. Section 21 defers to it |

### OD-82 — raised, not decided

**A direct contradiction was found and is recorded rather than resolved.**

The execution premise states that the standalone Voice Identity, Asset Intelligence, and Concierge
projects are **being harvested into and retired in favour of a unified HTBW project**.

[../governance/authority-order.md](../governance/authority-order.md) records as a **non-negotiable
constraint that binds regardless of rank**: *"Asset Intelligence, Voice Identity, and Concierge remain
**separate released products** with their own lifecycles."* **DL-08** and **DL-19** state the same
separation from the greenfield side.

**This ADR does not resolve that contradiction and does not assume either outcome.** Every statement
here holds whether the products are consolidated or remain separate, because this ADR governs the
**responsibility architecture** and not the **product portfolio**. **Acceptance of this ADR therefore
resolves nothing about OD-82**, and nothing here may be cited as evidence for either alternative. The
question is recorded as **OD-82** in
[../governance/decision-ledger.md](../governance/decision-ledger.md).
