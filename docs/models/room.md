## Purpose

The Room is the household's interaction context. It is what residents talk to, talk about, and
navigate in the UI.

## Question answered

*Which context is this request about, and which physical places does that context cover?*

---

## The three place concepts

| Concept | What it is | Who uses it |
|---|---|---|
| **Physical Room** | An actual physical space, normally an HA Area | Asset location, maintenance, environmental evidence, sensor provenance, diagnostics, precise facts |
| **Room** | The HTBW interaction context | Residents, voice assistants, Room Help, vocabulary, experiences |
| **Merged Room** | A Room composed of more than one Physical Room | Identical to a Room in behavior |

---

## The behavioral identity rule

**A Room and a Merged Room function the same way from the resident and runtime behavior
perspective.**

> Do not create separate orchestration logic simply because a Room is merged.

There is one Room contract. A Merged Room is a Room whose constituent set has more than one member.
Every rule about vocabulary, participation, exposure, Room Help, modes, experiences, transfer,
suppression, and explanation applies identically.

> **Merged Room composition is owned by Room Configuration.** Foundation defines what a Room and a
> Merged Room *are*; [room-configuration.md](room-configuration.md) declares which Physical Rooms
> constitute a given Room. Both sit inside Foundation, but composition has a single owner.

## Merged Room example

**Living Space** may combine:

- Kitchen
- Dining Room
- Living Room

The HTBW UI and runtime treat **Living Space** as a Room context.

The underlying Physical Rooms remain available for:

- Asset location
- Maintenance
- Environmental evidence
- Sensor provenance
- Diagnostics
- More precise facts where required

**Constituent membership is retained. It is never discarded by merging.**

---

## A Physical Room participates in at most one Merged Room (DL-67)

**A Merged Room is a curated conversational interaction context, not a general-purpose grouping
mechanism.** A Physical Room may be a constituent of at most one Merged Room at a time.

This is a necessary consequence of the behavioral identity rule above, not an independent limitation.
Overlapping membership would mean a single Physical Room belongs to two different Room Contexts at
once, which would force every consumer of Room Context — Truth's composite-fact input selection,
Continuity's sessions and transfers, Operational Trust's policy scoping, and Room Configuration's own
vocabulary resolution — to invent its own rule for which Merged Room currently applies. That is exactly
the special-case orchestration this document's behavioral identity rule forbids.

A household's desire for a broader or different grouping than its configured Merged Rooms (for example
"Downstairs lights") is met by Home Assistant's own native Floor, Area, and group/scene targeting —
never by an overlapping HTBW Merged Room. An Area already belongs to at most one Floor natively; there
is no accepted gap requiring HTBW to duplicate that hierarchy. If a household wants "Downstairs" as its
own curated interaction context, it configures a Merged Room for it in place of the narrower one its
constituent Physical Rooms previously belonged to — an ordinary reconfiguration, never a technical
limitation.

Because membership is exclusive, a shared sensor, device, or asset never contributes to two Merged
Rooms' composite Facts or vocabulary sets at once, and movement between two Merged Rooms that do not
share a constituent Physical Room is an ordinary Room transfer, exactly like movement between any two
distinct Rooms.

---

## Participation is explicit

A Merged Room may contain multiple participating voice assistants, speakers, lights, lamps, shades,
media devices, sensors, assets, and experiences.

> **Do not assume every asset in every constituent Room automatically participates in the merged Room
> interaction model.**

Participation is declared in [room-configuration.md](room-configuration.md).

If several music speakers are configured to participate as the speaker set for a Room, they are the
configured music destination for that Room. **Do not automatically include every Home Assistant
`media_player`.**

Worked example:

| Device | Disposition |
|---|---|
| Sonos room speakers | Selected as **"Speakers"** — the music destination |
| Sonos Beam (television sound) | Known to the asset model, **intentionally excluded** from the "Play Jazz" destination; still available for television audio |
| LG television | Exposed as **"TV"** |
| Apple TV | Exposed as **"Media Player"** |

---

## Movement inside a Merged Room is not a transfer

**A movement between constituent Physical Rooms inside the same Merged Room must not automatically be
treated as an experience transfer between two different HTBW Rooms.**

Walking from the Kitchen to the Living Room within *Living Space* changes no Room Context. Follow-Me
does not fire. No transfer is evaluated. No suppression is recorded.

Truth may still record the finer-grained Physical Room presence fact, because that fact has value for
diagnostics, environmental attribution, and precision — but the Room Context is unchanged.

## Room-scoped state

| Owner | Room-scoped content |
|---|---|
| Room Configuration (Foundation) | Constituent rooms, participation, exclusions, exposure, contextual vocabulary, Room Help definitions, composite-fact input selection, experience endpoints, relevant modes |
| Truth | Occupancy, presence, current activity, active room mode, composite environmental facts, device facts |
| Continuity | Last song played in the room, last genre played in the room, music volume, duck volume, TTS volume, current room experience, room-specific resume state |
| Operational Trust | Room-mode restrictions, privacy modes, quiet-hour restrictions, per-Room authority |
| Stewardship | Obligations attached to the room or to assets serving it, environmental limits to be protected |

## Relationship to Home Assistant

A Room normally maps to one or more Areas. Home Assistant has no native equivalent of a Room as an
interaction context, and no native equivalent of a Merged Room.

**A Merged Room has no native representation, and none is invented (DL-68).** A consumer inventory
(dashboards, native automations, Assist/Conversation, native targeting, scripts, scenes, labels,
groups, administrative views, external integrations) found no proven consumer that requires one.
Assist and Conversation specifically must never receive a native Merged Room projection: HTBW's own
vocabulary resolution already compiles a term down to a concrete, governed target set before any
native targeting occurs (see [contextual-vocabulary.md](contextual-vocabulary.md)), so a native Area
or Label standing in for a Merged Room would let Home Assistant's own built-in conversation agent
resolve it directly — bypassing the curated participation, exclusions, and exposure narrowing that
make it a Merged Room rather than an ordinary native grouping. Native Floors and Areas remain the
correct native constructs for a broader or capability-specific grouping ("Downstairs", "Upstairs");
see *A Physical Room participates in at most one Merged Room*, above.

Per the Home Assistant First principle, HTBW uses Areas as the constituent primitive and adds only
the Room construct that Home Assistant cannot practically represent. See
[../architecture/home-assistant-boundary.md](../architecture/home-assistant-boundary.md).

An Area may carry a natively assigned temperature or humidity entity. HTBW **consumes** those
assignments rather than building a competing room-sensor mechanism; how they participate in composite
facts is **OD-61**.

## Explicit non-responsibilities

The Room model does **not**:

- Establish what is happening in the Room — that is Truth
- Decide what is allowed in the Room — that is Operational Trust
- Store preferences or sessions — that is Continuity
- Decide what should happen — that is Concierge
- Calculate composite facts — Room Configuration selects eligible inputs; **Truth** calculates

## Failure behavior

| Condition | Behavior |
|---|---|
| A Room has no constituent Physical Rooms | Invalid configuration; report as a configuration problem |
| A constituent Area is deleted in Home Assistant | Report a broken constituent reference; do not silently shrink the Room |
| A Room has no participating voice assistant | Valid; the Room simply has no default voice context |
| Two Rooms claim the same Physical Room | Permitted only if the household configured it; ambiguity must be surfaced and resolved by explicit configuration, never by runtime preference |

## Privacy considerations

Room membership and occupancy history are sensitive. See
[../architecture/privacy.md](../architecture/privacy.md).

## Explainability requirements

Every Decision Trace records the resolved Room Context and, where relevant, which constituent
Physical Room supplied a fact.
