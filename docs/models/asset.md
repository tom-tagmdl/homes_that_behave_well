# Asset Model

> **Document status: Canonical model.**
> Terminology: [glossary.md](glossary.md). Owning responsibility: **Foundation** (descriptive
> knowledge). Significance and care belong to **Stewardship**: [stewardship.md](stewardship.md).

---

## Purpose

The HTBW asset model provides the **descriptive knowledge** the framework requires: what exists, what
it is, where it is, what it relates to, and what is known about it.

## Question answered

*What exists, and what do we authoritatively know about it?*

---

## Relationship to the standalone product

The standalone **Asset Intelligence** integration remains a separate released product with its own
lifecycle. This refoundation does not merge, modify, deprecate, or create compatibility requirements
for it.

HTBW Core may learn from its concepts, contracts, and household outcomes. HTBW Core is **not** required
to depend on it or copy its implementation. See
[../architecture/greenfield-mandate.md](../architecture/greenfield-mandate.md).

## What an Asset is

A **thing** the household has declared matters, whether or not it is device-backed:

- Device-backed: televisions, speakers, networking equipment, appliances, HVAC equipment
- Non-device: artwork, instruments, furniture, collections, documents, vehicles, structures

An Asset is **not** a Home Assistant Device. One Asset may map to zero, one, or several Devices.

> **People are not Assets. Pets are not Assets.**
>
> A Person and a Pet are distinct object types with their own definitions, and both may carry
> Stewardship care obligations **without being modelled as property**. No record in this repository
> represents a household member — human or animal — as an Asset, an inventory item, or an equipment
> record, and none may.

**That an Asset exists does not establish that it matters.** Registration is descriptive knowledge
owned here; **significance is a separate, household-declared judgement owned by Stewardship**. An
unregistered thing may matter enormously, and a registered one may matter not at all.

## Descriptive knowledge the asset model provides

- What exists
- Authoritative asset identity
- Asset type and capabilities
- Location
- Relationships
- Documentation
- Manuals
- Photos
- Purchase and installation records
- Manufacturer and model
- Serial number
- Warranty
- Service provider
- Environmental or operating limits
- Maintenance-relevant metadata
- Physical and logical relationships
- Rooms served
- Person, pet, room, or home relationships
- Caretaker-of and owner-of relationships, as relationship *types*; the caretaker assignment itself is
  owned by [stewardship.md](stewardship.md)

## Object distinctions

**Do not automatically treat a Home Assistant Device, Home Assistant Entity, HTBW Asset, Person, Pet,
Room, or Service as the same object.**

| Object | Definition | Distinguishing property |
|---|---|---|
| Home Assistant Device | A platform registry object | Exists because an integration created it |
| Home Assistant Entity | A platform state-bearing object | Carries state; is not a household concept |
| HTBW Asset | A household thing that matters | May have no device at all; carries provenance, documentation, and lifecycle |
| Person | A human household member | Carries roles, consent, identity evidence, authority |
| Pet | A non-human household member | Carries obligations; is not a Person |
| Room | An interaction context | Is a place plus an interaction definition |
| Service | An external provider relationship | Is a relationship, not a thing in the home |

A single physical object may be an Asset **and** be represented by several Devices and many Entities.
The Asset is the household-meaningful object.

## Asset-scoped content

| Content | Notes |
|---|---|
| Authoritative asset identity | The formal name, for example *1918 A.B. Chase 6' Grand Piano* |
| Documentation | Manuals, photos, receipts, appraisals, certificates |
| Service plan | Owned as an obligation by Stewardship; referenced here |
| Environmental limits | Operating and preservation limits the asset requires |
| Warranty | Coverage window, provider, terms reference |
| Maintenance history | Record of what was done and when |
| Assigned caretaker | A reference to the Stewardship-owned caretaker assignment, expressed as a Foundation caretaker-of relationship |
| Rooms served | An asset may serve more than one Room |

An asset's **authoritative name is never replaced by a vocabulary term.** "Piano" is an interaction
alias in a Room; the asset remains *1918 A.B. Chase 6' Grand Piano*. See
[contextual-vocabulary.md](contextual-vocabulary.md).

## How the asset model and Stewardship cooperate

They must not be collapsed into one indistinguishable responsibility.

| Question | Owner |
|---|---|
| What is this thing, and what do we know about it? | Asset model (Foundation) |
| Where is it, and what does it relate to? — as **declared** knowledge | Asset model (Foundation), through the `located-in` relationship |
| **Where is it *now*?** | **Truth**, as a Location Fact with confidence, provenance, freshness, and validity |
| What are its environmental limits, as a property of the thing? | Asset model (Foundation) |
| Does it matter, and how much? | Stewardship |
| What care does it require, and when? | Stewardship |
| Is a care obligation currently met, due, or overdue? | Stewardship |
| Who is accountable for it? | Stewardship (owns the caretaker assignment), recorded through a Foundation caretaker-of relationship |
| Is its environment currently within limits? | **Truth** |
| Should we do something about it now? | **Concierge** |

Worked example:

```
Asset model:   The piano requires 40–60% relative humidity.
Truth:         The Music Room is at 31% relative humidity.
Stewardship:   The piano's preservation obligation is unmet.
Operational Trust: Humidifier control is permitted autonomously; notification requires no confirmation.
Concierge:     Raise humidity, notify the caretaker, and explain.
```

## Participation and exposure

Asset existence does **not** imply participation in any Room's interaction model, and participation
does not imply exposure. See [room-configuration.md](room-configuration.md).

An asset may be:

- known and not participating (a Sonos Beam excluded from music)
- participating and not exposed (a temperature sensor feeding a composite fact)
- exposed as an individual (the TV)
- exposed as part of a group (one of seven shades)
- exposed as a knowledge asset (the piano)

## Native representation

Governed by **DL-31** and
[../architecture/home-assistant-boundary.md](../architecture/home-assistant-boundary.md).

An Asset is **not** a Home Assistant Device. It may nonetheless **be represented by** one, and where a
native representation exists the household gains dashboards, automations, targeting, Area
relationships, and Assist without HTBW building a parallel hierarchy.

| Case | Required behaviour |
|---|---|
| The Asset is already backed by one or more existing Devices | **Reference them.** Do not create an additional Device, and do not copy manufacturer, model, serial number, versions, or Area assignment |
| The Asset has no native backing — artwork, an instrument, furniture, a collection | The integration **may create a native Device** for it through the supported registration pattern, so the Asset is natively visible |
| The Asset spans several Devices | The Asset remains the single household-meaningful object. It does not become several Assets |

Once a native Device exists, Home Assistant is authoritative for the registry entry and its native
fields. HTBW retains the device identifier and only the Asset knowledge Home Assistant does not hold:
identity, documentation references, provenance, appraisal and warranty references, environmental and
operating limits, relationships, and rooms served. **These need not all live in one record or one
responsibility** — significance and care remain **Stewardship's**, current conditions remain
**Truth's**, and documents remain anchored in connected storage rather than copied.

### Asset Type

**Asset Type is authoritative in HTBW and owned by Foundation**, as descriptive knowledge of *what
this thing is*. It is not a user-interface filter, and it is not owned by a Label.

| Layer | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Asset Type | **Foundation (asset model)** | **Authoritative.** Changed only through the governed HTBW mechanism |
| Native Label | Home Assistant owns the Label object | **A derived, HTBW-managed projection** of the authoritative type |
| Device class | Home Assistant | **Not available.** Device `entry_type` supports only `None` and `service`; device classes are entity classifications. **No custom "Asset" device class may be claimed** |

Fine Art, Sculpture, Collection, Antique, Furniture, and Instrument are **examples, not a closed
taxonomy**.

Required behaviour for the managed projection:

- Residents maintain **the type only**. They must never be asked to maintain type and labels separately
- HTBW maintains its **reserved** labels; resident-created labels are **never removed or overwritten**
- **A failed or missing label projection never silently changes the Asset Type**
- Reconciliation, where reported, uses the existing Repairs boundary (**OD-60**)

The reserved taxonomy's naming, seeding, collision handling, versioning, retirement, and reconciliation
mechanism are **OD-68**. No punctuation, casing, namespacing, or label identifiers are prescribed here.

### Asset-derived Entities

Where an Asset-related value is useful natively, it may be **published as an Entity**. The Entity is a
**projection**: it never becomes a second authority for a value another responsibility determines.
Obligation state remains **Stewardship's**, current conditions remain **Truth's**, and the projected
value stays explainable back to its inputs. Which values are projected, on which entity platform, and
with which state vocabulary is **OD-69** — HTBW defines no "asset health" state model, and none is
invented here.

---

## Consumes

- Home Assistant Device, Entity, and Area references where applicable
- Connected-storage documents anchored to the asset

## Provides

- Authoritative asset identity and descriptive knowledge
- Capability descriptions consumed by Room Configuration and Concierge
- Environmental and operating limits consumed by Stewardship and Truth
- Relationships consumed across the framework

## Explicit non-responsibilities

The asset model does **not** decide significance, own obligations, evaluate current conditions, grant
authority, or orchestrate.

---

## Failure behavior

| Condition | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Backing Device removed | Report a broken anchor; retain the asset and its knowledge |
| Documentation unreachable in connected storage | Report unavailable; do not claim absence |
| Asset location unknown | Represent as unknown; do not default to a Room |
| Duplicate assets suspected | Surface for household resolution; do not auto-merge |

## Deletion and cleanup

**The Asset is the governing parent of its documentation** (**DL-45**). Foundation owns the Asset and
its documentation anchor; Stewardship owns significance and care, not the document artifact.

| Event | Required behavior |
|---|---|
| **A single document is deleted** | The artifact is removed, its governed reference is removed or tombstoned, empty dependent structures may be removed, and **the Asset remains** |
| **The Asset is deleted** | All associated artifact references are enumerated; every document without an overriding retention or preservation rule is deleted; Asset-specific structures are removed once empty; **cleanup failure is surfaced**; and deletion is **not reported complete while mandatory cleanup remains unresolved**, unless the accepted lifecycle supports a pending-cleanup state |
| **Storage is unavailable during cleanup** | **Deletion is not claimed.** A governed pending-cleanup state is retained, the reference is not discarded, and reconciliation follows once storage returns |
| **A hold or retention floor applies** | The artifact remains, governed and explained. **Cleanup never silently overrides a Preservation Hold or a retention floor** |

Historical governance records may remain where required, **but they must not retain the document
payload without authority**. The backing Home Assistant Device follows its own lifecycle and is
**never removed because an artifact structure was cleaned**.

Documents are reached through the Asset and its document list — **never through a storage hierarchy**
(**DL-44**).

## Privacy considerations

Asset records may reveal value, ownership, and household absence patterns. Visibility of asset value,
documentation, and location history is governed by Operational Trust policy.

## Explainability requirements

Any decision that relied on an asset's limits, warranty, service relationship, or caretaker records
that fact and its source in the Decision Trace.

## Open decisions

| ID | Question |
|---|---|
| OD-01 | Home Assistant representation strategy for HTBW Assets — the representation rule is accepted as **DL-31**; the residual is the persistence shape of governed records |
| OD-02 | **Closed — DL-43, DL-44, DL-45.** Documentation, manuals, photos, and records are located through a governed artifact reference; file formats remain capability-specific |
| OD-68 | Reserved Asset Type label taxonomy and its projection mechanism |
| OD-69 | Which Asset-related values are projected as Entities, on which platform, and with which state vocabulary |
| OD-20 | Whether HTBW Core consumes the standalone Asset Intelligence product as an optional evidence source, and through what interface |
