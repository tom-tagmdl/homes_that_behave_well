# Canonical Continuity Use Cases

> **Document status: Canonical scenario.**
> Terminology: [../models/glossary.md](../models/glossary.md).
> Index: [README.md](README.md). Owning responsibility: **Continuity**.
> Model: [../models/continuity.md](../models/continuity.md),
> [../models/experience-and-session.md](../models/experience-and-session.md).

## Purpose

[follow-me-media.md](follow-me-media.md) proves the **handoff** — transfer versus resume, eligibility
versus decision, suppression as a deliberate outcome. This document proves the **boundary of
remembering**: what Continuity actually holds, what it merely references, what belongs to another
responsibility that happens to have a history, and what the home must never claim to remember.

These fifteen use cases arose as **architecture stress tests** during narrative development of
*Season 1 Episode 7 — Continuity: How Does a Home Remember What Matters?* They are recorded here as
canonical Continuity use cases and as **future acceptance scenarios**.

**The narrative is not architecture.** It was used to find questions the accepted architecture must
answer. Where it proposed something the accepted architecture does not support, the accepted
architecture prevailed and the narration is remediated. See
[../governance/decision-ledger.md](../governance/decision-ledger.md).

---

## The doctrine these use cases enforce

> **Continuity holds what the household wants remembered so an experience can continue. It does not
> hold everything that happened, it does not decide what happens next, and it does not become the
> owner of another responsibility's history.**

Stated in the form the household hears:

> **The home remembers what lets life continue.**

Behind that summary, precisely:

| Statement | Owner |
|---|---|
| *What is true right now* | **Truth** |
| *Who is engaging, and how confidently* | **Identity** |
| *What matters and requires care* | **Stewardship** |
| *What is wanted, and what was left running* | **Continuity** |
| *Whether this is appropriate for this request, in this context* | **Operational Trust** |
| *What should happen now, and how it is said* | **Concierge** |
| *The action itself* | An **executor** — a Home Assistant automation, script, scene, service call, integration, or a person |

**Continuity supplies state, intent, and eligibility. Continuity does not choose the final action**
([../contracts/continuity-contract.md](../contracts/continuity-contract.md), *The decisive boundary*;
[../architecture/dependency-view.md](../architecture/dependency-view.md) rule 5).

---

## The four separations this document exists to protect

**1. A memory is not an observation.**
An occurrence in the household is a **Domain Event**, owned by the responsibility that observed it. A
change to a governed record is a **Change Record**. Neither is a Continuity preference.
See [../models/glossary.md](../models/glossary.md) and
[../models/temporal-record.md](../models/temporal-record.md).

**2. An observation is not a preference.**
An observed pattern must not silently become an autonomous policy (**P26**, **DL-21**). The promotion
ladder — *Observation → Pattern → Suggestion → Approved preference → Adaptive policy* — is stated in
[../architecture/behavioral-governance.md](../architecture/behavioral-governance.md) and is not
restated here.

**3. A preference is not a recommendation, and a recommendation is not an authorisation.**
A Preference is *a person-scoped or room-scoped statement of what is wanted*; it *is not a fact and
not a policy* ([../models/glossary.md](../models/glossary.md)). A Reasoning Provider *owns nothing*,
and *its recommendation never silently becomes an authorised action* (same source; strategy is
**OD-67**).

**4. Continuity is not the home's history.**
Each responsibility owns the history of its own records under the shared temporal model
([../models/temporal-record.md](../models/temporal-record.md)). Truth owns Fact history. Stewardship
owns obligation, maintenance, service, and caretaker history. Concierge owns decision history.
Continuity owns **preference, session, resume, transfer, and experience history — and nothing else**.

---

## Status legend

HTBW Core is **greenfield** ([../architecture/greenfield-mandate.md](../architecture/greenfield-mandate.md),
**DL-19**). Nothing in this document asserts an implemented HTBW Core capability.

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **A** | **Accepted architecture** — stated in a canonical HTBW document |
| **E** | **Architectural expectation** — follows from accepted architecture, not yet written into a canonical model or contract |
| **U** | **Unresolved decision** — held by a named open decision (OD) |
| **F** | **Future implementation requirement** — no HTBW Core implementation exists |
| **N** | **Not governed** — the repository says nothing, and nothing here creates it |
| **P** | **Partially present in a separate released product** — Asset Intelligence, Voice Identity, or Concierge. **This is not HTBW Core capability** and creates no compatibility requirement (**DL-19**) |

## The household used throughout

The household of [README.md](README.md), extended only where a use case requires it:

```
Home
├── Living Space            (Merged Room: Kitchen + Dining + Living)
├── Den
├── Office
├── Primary Bedroom
├── Music Room
└── Garage

People:  Tom, David
Pets:    Maisey
Assets:  Sonos speakers, Sonos Beam, LG television, Apple TV,
         7 shades, 1918 A.B. Chase 6' Grand Piano,
         a signed watercolour in the Den
```

---

## How to read a use case

Each use case is presented as:

1. **Human outcome** — what the household actually gets
2. **Preconditions** — what must already be true, configured, or consented
3. **Ownership map** — the fourteen handoffs, each with exactly one owner
4. **Walkthrough** — the attributed steps, where the use case needs one
5. **Expected outcome, failure behaviour, and explanation**
6. **Acceptance scenarios** — what a conforming implementation must and must not do
7. **Implementation status and unresolved decisions**

**Every ownership map answers the same fourteen questions**, so the use cases can be compared without
re-reading them:

| # | Question |
|---|---|
| 1 | Authoritative Truth inputs |
| 2 | Identity requirements |
| 3 | Consent and Operational Trust requirements |
| 4 | What Continuity supplies |
| 5 | Memory scope |
| 6 | Source of record |
| 7 | Who decides |
| 8 | Who executes |
| 9 | Explainability |
| 10 | Retention and lifecycle |
| 11 | Guest and Unknown Person behaviour |
| 12 | Multi-person conflict behaviour |
| 13 | Failure behaviour |
| 14 | What must never happen |

# Use Case 1 — Comfort Restoration

## Human outcome

Tom says *"turn on the lamps"* in the Office and gets the light level he actually uses, not a
factory-default 100%.

## Preconditions

| Precondition | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Office lamp vocabulary is configured | Room Configuration / Contextual Vocabulary | **A** |
| A room-scoped lamp level exists as a Continuity record | **Continuity** | **A** — [../models/continuity.md](../models/continuity.md) holds *last lamp levels, last speaker volume* |
| Restoration is explicitly configured rather than inferred | Household configuration | **A** — [../patterns/execution-patterns.md](../patterns/execution-patterns.md), *State Restoration Execution* |
| **Which remembered value class is restored** | — | **U — OD-78** |

## Ownership map

| # | Question | Owner | Statement |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Authoritative Truth inputs | **Truth** | Current entity availability, Room mode, and any environmental constraint. **A remembered value is not a Fact** |
| 2 | Identity requirements | **Identity** | **None for a room-scoped value.** A *person*-preferred level requires an Identity Assertion meeting the configured band (**DL-39**, **DL-36**) |
| 3 | Consent and Operational Trust requirements | **Operational Trust** | Whether the level may be applied at Explicit, Assisted, or Autonomous level; whether Room mode prohibits it |
| 4 | What Continuity supplies | **Continuity** | The remembered value and its scope. **Not the decision to apply it** |
| 5 | Memory scope | **Room-scoped** for lamp level, music volume, duck volume, TTS volume. **Person-scoped** only where an approved preference exists | **A** |
| 6 | Source of record | **Home Assistant** for current entity state (**DL-46**). Continuity for the governed remembered value | **A** |
| 7 | Who decides | **Concierge** | — |
| 8 | Who executes | An **executor** — service call, scene, or script | — |
| 9 | Explainability | **Decision Trace** | Which remembered value, at which version (**P30**, **DL-27**), and why it was applied or not |
| 10 | Retention and lifecycle | **DL-47** | Preference history is Continuity's; entity-state history is Home Assistant's and is **not copied** (**DL-46**) |
| 11 | Guest and Unknown Person behaviour | **Operational Trust** | An Unknown Person *owns no preferences or history, inherits nothing from any resident, generates no person-scoped learning* (**DL-33**) |
| 12 | Multi-person conflict behaviour | **Operational Trust** / **Concierge** | Room-scoped values are shared; a person-scoped value is not applied on another person's behalf |
| 13 | Failure behaviour | **Continuity** | *Do not substitute a platform default silently; state that the preference could not be read* |
| 14 | What must never happen | — | **Guessing a previous value, reconstructing state from history, or presenting a default as a remembered value** |

## Expected outcome, failure behaviour, and explanation

> *"I set the Office lamps to the level you normally use here."*

If the remembered value cannot be read, the home says so rather than silently applying a default.

## Acceptance scenarios

| # | Given | Then | Must not |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | A room-scoped lamp level exists | It is applied where policy permits | Apply a *person* level without a sufficient Identity Assertion |
| 1.2 | No remembered value exists | The home states the absence | Substitute a platform default silently |
| 1.3 | A person-preferred level exists but was never accepted | The home **asks** | Apply it silently (**P26**, **DL-21**) |
| 1.4 | Room mode prohibits the change | Suppressed, with a reason in the trace | Present suppression as a failure |
| 1.5 | The remembered value conflicts with a current environmental constraint | **Unresolved — OD-78** | Assert that the architecture already decides this |

## Implementation status and unresolved decisions

**F** — no HTBW Core implementation exists.

| Concern | Held by |
|---|---|
| Whether restoration reproduces a prior value or computes a currently appropriate one; the value classes (*last observed*, *last successful*, *last person-selected*, *configured default*, *preference*) | **OD-78** |
| Prior/preferred **room temperature** as a Continuity-held value | **N** — no canonical document states it |
| Learned-preference promotion | **OD-28**; evidence eligibility **OD-65** |

# Use Case 2 — The Dental Appointment Reminder

## Human outcome

Tom is in the Den in the evening. The home tells him about tomorrow's 6:30 dental appointment at a
moment that is actually useful, and does not announce it in front of guests.

## Preconditions

| Precondition | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|
| A calendar integration is configured and available | Home Assistant | **A** — **P21** |
| **The association between Tom and that calendar** | — | **U — OD-77** |
| Interruption appropriateness for this moment | **Operational Trust** | **A** — defaults are **OD-51** |
| Audience composition in the Den | **Truth** → **Operational Trust** | **A** — **DL-34**; specification is **OD-52** |

## Ownership map

| # | Question | Owner | Statement |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Authoritative Truth inputs | **Truth** | Tom is present in the Den; who else is present; current time |
| 2 | Identity requirements | **Identity** | A person-directed Communication requires an Identity Assertion meeting the configured band |
| 3 | Consent and Operational Trust requirements | **Operational Trust** | Whether Tom's calendar content may be disclosed, on this surface, before this audience (**DL-34**, **P32**) |
| 4 | What Continuity supplies | **Continuity** | **Preferred delivery and preferred presentation**, and the **re-presentation preference** if Tom moves (**OD-48**). **Not the appointment** |
| 5 | Memory scope | **Person-scoped** for the delivery/presentation preference | **A** |
| 6 | Source of record | **The calendar provider.** HTBW holds a reference; *the underlying configuration is never copied* ([../models/person-and-identity.md](../models/person-and-identity.md)) | **A** |
| 7 | Who decides | **Concierge** | Whether, when, where, and how to say it |
| 8 | Who executes | **Concierge**, through a governed delivery surface | — |
| 9 | Explainability | **Decision Trace** | Why now, why here, why this surface, and why not earlier |
| 10 | Retention and lifecycle | **DL-47**, **OD-49** | Communication content and metadata are classified **separately** |
| 11 | Guest and Unknown Person behaviour | **Operational Trust** | Private content is not disclosed to an unresolved audience; the fallback is **OD-71** |
| 12 | Multi-person conflict behaviour | **Operational Trust** | David's presence changes the audience, not the truth of the appointment |
| 13 | Failure behaviour | **DL-41** | No calendar provider configured, valid, and available → **the capability is unavailable and says so**. No local approximation stands in for it |
| 14 | What must never happen | — | **Claiming a departure time the home cannot compute**, or treating a calendar entry as a Stewardship care obligation the household never declared |

## The architecture-faithful narration

| Proposed narration | Verdict | Correct wording |
|---|---|---|
| *The Home remembered the commitment* | **Requires qualification** | The **calendar provider** holds the commitment. The home **reconnected Tom to it** and chose an appropriate moment |
| *Continuity preserved the association and relevant context* | **Not yet governed** | The person-to-calendar association has **no named owner** — **OD-77** |
| *Concierge selected an appropriate moment to remind* | **Accepted** | — |
| *Operational Trust permitted disclosure* | **Accepted** | — |
| *Stewardship marked the commitment as requiring care* | **Contradicted** | **A calendar appointment is not a care obligation.** Stewardship represents a care expectation **the household declared**; it never decides on the household's behalf that something matters |

## Acceptance scenarios

| # | Given | Then | Must not |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2.1 | Guests are present | Content-free indication or deferral, per **OD-71** | Read a private appointment aloud |
| 2.2 | The calendar provider is unavailable | The capability is unavailable and names the missing dependency | Present a stale entry as current |
| 2.3 | Tom acknowledges | Re-presentation stops | Repeat on every surface Tom passes |
| 2.4 | Travel time is requested | **Not a claimed capability** | Assert a departure time |

## Implementation status and unresolved decisions

**F**. Held by **OD-77** (person-to-calendar association), **OD-51** (interruption risk classes),
**OD-52** (audience specification), **OD-71** (audience uncertainty), **OD-44**/**OD-45** (delivery
and acknowledgement semantics), **OD-54** (retry is never escalation), **OD-48** (re-presentation).
**Travel-time and routing computation are `N` — not governed, not claimed.**

# Use Case 3 — Follow-Me Music, Den to Kitchen

## Human outcome

Tom is listening to jazz in the Den, goes to cook, and the jazz is playing in the Living Space when
he gets there — at a sensible volume, without duplicating in the Den.

## Preconditions

| Precondition | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Follow-Me enabled for the person or session | **Continuity** | **A** |
| Identity resolved above the configured band | **Identity** | **A** |
| Unambiguous room transition, origin and destination both known and different | **Truth** | **A** |
| Manual-stop protection and cooldown not active | **Continuity** | **A** |
| Destination Room has configured, valid, available playback targets | Room Configuration + **Truth** | **A** |

## Ownership map

| # | Question | Owner | Statement |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Authoritative Truth inputs | **Truth** | Presence, room transition, existing destination experience, endpoint availability, Room mode |
| 2 | Identity requirements | **Identity** | Whose session is this, and is the person in the destination the session owner |
| 3 | Consent and Operational Trust requirements | **Operational Trust** | Explicit / Assisted / Autonomous mode; authority to displace another person's session |
| 4 | What Continuity supplies | **Continuity** | Session identity, owner, participants, origin Room, current Room, Follow-Me intent, **transfer eligibility with blocking attribution** |
| 5 | Memory scope | **Person-scoped**: preferred artist, genre, album, playlist; personal Follow-Me setting; current personal media session. **Room-scoped**: last song, last genre, music volume, duck volume, TTS volume | **A** — the preserved scoping rule |
| 6 | Source of record | **The media provider and Home Assistant** for playback state (**DL-46**, **P21**) | **A** |
| 7 | Who decides | **Concierge** | — |
| 8 | Who executes | **Concierge**, through governed interfaces | Continuity never performs playback |
| 9 | Explainability | **Decision Trace** | *"I moved the jazz because you asked the music to follow you, I recognised you here, and the room was free"* |
| 10 | Retention and lifecycle | **DL-47** | Session and transfer history are Continuity's; scope and duration of experience history are **OD-26** |
| 11 | Guest and Unknown Person behaviour | **Operational Trust** | An Unknown Person owns no session and inherits no preference (**DL-33**) |
| 12 | Multi-person conflict behaviour | **Operational Trust** / **Concierge** | *Another person's session would be displaced without authority* is a representable block. Merge policy is **OD-24**; concurrency is **OD-27** |
| 13 | Failure behaviour | **Continuity** | Missed transition → treat the newly observed Room as current, record the gap, **do not retroactively transfer**. Partial speaker-group availability → configured policy, and say which members were unavailable |
| 14 | What must never happen | — | **Motion-triggered movement.** Follow-Me is a policy-governed handoff |

## The utterance problem

The proposed narration has Tom say *"I need to make dinner"* and the home answer *"I'll move the music
to the kitchen for you."*

| Element | Verdict | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| The transfer itself | **Supported** | [follow-me-media.md](follow-me-media.md) Scenario 1 |
| An **explicit** trigger — *"Have the music follow me"* | **Supported** | The canonical trigger in every accepted document |
| A **standing** Follow-Me preference producing an autonomous move | **Supported** | The Autonomous mode, *because policy permits it* |
| **Inferring a media-transfer intent from *"I need to make dinner"*** | **Not yet governed** | No accepted document maps an indirect utterance to a room-to-room media transfer. Intent interpretation is Concierge's, but **no rule authorises this inference**, and **DL-30** is not discharged by assertion |
| Movement inside the **Living Space** Merged Room | **Neither transfer nor resume** | No Room Context changed |

**Narration remedy:** either Tom asks for the music to follow him, or the household has already
enabled Follow-Me and the home moves it because the household said it may. The home may also **offer**
— *"Would you like the music in the kitchen?"* — which is the Assisted mode and is fully governed.

## Acceptance scenarios

| # | Given | Then | Must not |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3.1 | Follow-Me enabled, transition unambiguous, destination free | Eligible; Concierge transfers | Treat eligibility as the decision |
| 3.2 | Destination Room in Nighttime mode | `transfer_eligible: false`, `blocked_by: operational_trust` | Report suppression as a failure |
| 3.3 | David's session is already active in the destination | Displacement requires authority | Merge or terminate unilaterally |
| 3.4 | Kitchen and Dining are inside the Living Space Merged Room | Nothing happens, and nothing needs to | Invent a merged-room orchestration path |
| 3.5 | Tom stopped the music by hand a minute ago | Manual-stop protection blocks the move | Override a manual stop |
| 3.6 | The provider's session cannot be handed off | **Unresolved** — provider session semantics are `N` | Claim a governed handoff protocol exists |

## Implementation status and unresolved decisions

**F**. Governed: eligibility, blocking, scoping, suppression. Unresolved: **OD-24** merge, **OD-25**
resume window, **OD-27** concurrency. **Not governed (`N`)**: provider session-state handoff, grouped
playback and join semantics, duplicate-playback prevention as a named rule, and indirect-intent
inference.

# Use Case 4 — Audiobook Resume

## Human outcome

David picks up his book in the Primary Bedroom where he left it in the Den yesterday.

## Preconditions

| Precondition | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|
| A resume candidate exists within its eligibility window | **Continuity** | **A** — window defaults are **OD-25** |
| The playback position | **The audiobook provider** | **A** — **DL-46**, **P21** |
| **The association between David and that audiobook account** | — | **U — OD-77** |

## Ownership map

| # | Question | Owner | Statement |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Authoritative Truth inputs | **Truth** | David is present; the destination Room has no conflicting active session |
| 2 | Identity requirements | **Identity** | Person-scoped resume requires a sufficient Identity Assertion |
| 3 | Consent and Operational Trust requirements | **Operational Trust** | Whether resume is Explicit, Assisted, or Autonomous for this class |
| 4 | What Continuity supplies | **Continuity** | Resume state, resume eligibility, session ownership, and a **Governed Reference** to the provider's position |
| 5 | Memory scope | **Person-scoped** session ownership; **room-scoped** resume state where the household configured it that way | **A** |
| 6 | Source of record | **The provider.** HTBW *persists no second copy merely to explain later* (**DL-46**) | **A** |
| 7 | Who decides | **Concierge** | Offer, resume, or stay silent |
| 8 | Who executes | An executor, through governed interfaces | — |
| 9 | Explainability | **Decision Trace** | *"You left this in the Den yesterday evening"* |
| 10 | Retention and lifecycle | **OD-25**, **OD-26**, **DL-47** | When a resume candidate expires, and whether experience history is per person, per room, or both |
| 11 | Guest and Unknown Person behaviour | **DL-33** | An Unknown Person has no resume candidate and inherits none |
| 12 | Multi-person conflict behaviour | **Continuity** → **Operational Trust** | Household-shared progress and person-specific progress are different records; the distinction depends on **OD-77** |
| 13 | Failure behaviour | **DL-41** | Provider unavailable → capability unavailable, dependency named. **A remembered position is never re-derived** |
| 14 | What must never happen | — | **Duplicating the provider's playback position into HTBW as a second source of record** |

## On the words *journey*, *checkpoint*, and *progress marker*

**None of these is a first-class HTBW model.** The glossary defines **Experience** and **Session**;
there is no Journey object, no checkpoint object, and no progress-marker object. They are acceptable
as **narrative groupings** and must not be presented as architecture. What is real is: an Experience,
a Session with a lifecycle, a resume candidate, an eligibility window, and a **Governed Reference** to
provider-owned state.

## Acceptance scenarios

| # | Given | Then | Must not |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4.1 | A resume candidate is within its window | Concierge may offer or resume, per policy | Resume autonomously where the mode is Assisted |
| 4.2 | The window has expired | No offer | Offer a months-old candidate as though it were current |
| 4.3 | Provider position and remembered reference disagree | **The provider is authoritative** | Present the HTBW reference as the position |
| 4.4 | Two people share one household account | **Unresolved — OD-77** | Attribute one person's progress to another |

## Implementation status and unresolved decisions

**F**. Held by **OD-25**, **OD-26**, **OD-77**. Conflict resolution between provider state and
remembered reference is `E` — it follows from **DL-46** but is not written into a canonical model.

# Use Case 5 — Tom and David's Interaction Styles

## Human outcome

Tom gets the thorough answer with its evidence. David gets the short one. Neither gets a *different*
answer.

## Preconditions

| Precondition | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Continuity holds preferred delivery and preferred presentation | **Continuity** | **A** — [stewardship-use-cases.md](stewardship-use-cases.md) ownership map row 11; [../models/communication.md](../models/communication.md) *Continuity — re-presentation preference and personal surface defaults* |
| Identity resolves the person to a band sufficient for person-scoped preference application | **Identity** → **Operational Trust** | **A** — **DL-36**, **DL-39** |
| **The preference dimensions themselves** — verbosity, depth, citation, modality, locale, accessibility, per-capability override | — | **N / U** — stated only in Historical documents; see below |

## Ownership map

| # | Question | Owner | Statement |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Authoritative Truth inputs | **Truth** | Who is present and can perceive the surface |
| 2 | Identity requirements | **Identity** | **Applying a person's preferences is a person-scoped capability access**, evaluated against the current Identity Assertion — *not a consequence of the home having addressed someone by name* |
| 3 | Consent and Operational Trust requirements | **Operational Trust** | Whether person-scoped preference participation is consented; consent *gates eligibility, not weight* |
| 4 | What Continuity supplies | **Continuity** | The preferred delivery and presentation, versioned and revocable |
| 5 | Memory scope | **Person-scoped** | **A** |
| 6 | Source of record | **Continuity** | This is one of the few classes HTBW genuinely owns |
| 7 | Who decides | **Concierge** | Presentation is Concierge's; the preference is not |
| 8 | Who executes | **Concierge**, optionally assisted by a **Reasoning Provider** | The provider *owns nothing* |
| 9 | Explainability | **Decision Trace** | The **exact version** of the preference used (**P30**) |
| 10 | Retention and lifecycle | **DL-47** | Preference history is Continuity's |
| 11 | Guest and Unknown Person behaviour | **DL-33** | An Unknown Person *owns no preferences* and *inherits nothing from any resident* |
| 12 | Multi-person conflict behaviour | **Operational Trust** | With both present, the audience governs; one person's verbosity preference does not select what the other may hear |
| 13 | Failure behaviour | **DL-41** | No reasoning provider configured, valid, and available → the dependent capability is unavailable and says so. **Removing the provider degrades phrasing, never correctness** |
| 14 | What must never happen | — | **A presentation preference changing what is true.** Preferences influence how something is said, never whether it is so |

## Where the preference dimensions actually stand

| Dimension | Where it appears | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `verbosity: minimal / balanced / detailed` | [../models/person-profile-model.md](../models/person-profile-model.md) | **Historical — superseded.** Not authority |
| *person context may tune verbosity and detail level only* | [../contracts/service-contracts.md](../contracts/service-contracts.md) | **Historical — superseded.** Not authority |
| *presentation preferences* | [../architecture/adr-personalization-governance.md](../architecture/adr-personalization-governance.md) | **Historical — superseded.** Not authority |
| *Preferred interaction patterns* | [../models/continuity.md](../models/continuity.md) | **Canonical**, but named only in the Stewardship-boundary table |

**The ownership is settled — Continuity. The enumeration is not written anywhere canonical.** That is
documentation debt, now recorded as a clarification in the Continuity model and contract.

**Whether a person-scoped preference may name or steer a reasoning provider is OD-67**, and nothing
here presumes a provider abstraction.

## Acceptance scenarios

| # | Given | Then | Must not |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5.1 | Tom's detailed preference is held and Identity is sufficient | The answer is fuller | Change any fact, threshold, or conclusion |
| 5.2 | Identity is below the required band | Neutral presentation | Refuse the underlying request because a *presentation* threshold was unmet |
| 5.3 | Both Tom and David are present | Audience governs | Apply one resident's preference to content the other may not receive |
| 5.4 | The reasoning provider is unavailable | Plain, correct phrasing | Silently approximate it locally |

## Implementation status and unresolved decisions

**F**. Ownership **A**; enumeration `N`; provider preference **OD-67**; consent experience **OD-06**.

# Use Case 6 — Person-to-Calendar and Person-to-Mailbox Associations

## Human outcome

*"What's on my calendar?"* returns Tom's calendar for Tom and David's for David, without either
gaining access to the other's.

## Preconditions

| Precondition | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Calendar and mailbox integrations exist and are configured | Home Assistant | **A** — **P21** |
| HTBW references them and never copies their configuration | Foundation / **P22** | **A** — [../models/person-and-identity.md](../models/person-and-identity.md) |
| **A governed person-to-external-resource association with a named owner** | — | **U — OD-77.** This is the defect |

## The verified gap

[../models/person-and-identity.md](../models/person-and-identity.md) lists the extension:

> | Mailbox, calendar, and other external-service references | Referenced through the responsibility that governs their use; **the underlying configuration is never copied** |

**No responsibility is named**, and [../contracts/foundation-contract.md](../contracts/foundation-contract.md)
declares the relationship types as **`caretaker-of`, `owner-of`, `serves-room`, and `located-in`** —
none of which expresses *this account belongs to this person*.

Every personal-resource use case in this document depends on that association: the dental reminder,
the audiobook resume, the person-scoped media profile, and the mail summary. **It is recorded as a
defect rather than invented here.**

## Ownership map

| # | Question | Owner | Statement |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Authoritative Truth inputs | **Truth** | Presence and audience only. An association is a definition, not a Fact |
| 2 | Identity requirements | **Identity** | Establishes *who is asking*, to a band the capability requires |
| 3 | Consent and Operational Trust requirements | **Operational Trust** | *Who may access calendars, messages, email, or history* is explicitly Operational Trust's |

| 5 | Memory scope | **Person-scoped**, once an owner exists | **U — OD-77** |
| 6 | Source of record | **The provider.** HTBW owns no calendar contents, no mailbox contents, and **no credentials** | **A** — **P22**, [../architecture/connected-storage.md](../architecture/connected-storage.md) |

| 9 | Explainability | **Decision Trace** | Which association was used, and why the request was answered or refused |
| 10 | Retention and lifecycle | **DL-43**, **DL-45**, **DL-47** | Revocation, reassignment, participant removal, and stale-association detection are part of **OD-77** |
| 11 | Guest and Unknown Person behaviour | **DL-33** | An Unknown Person *references no Person* and *grants nothing*. Access defaults to household-neutral context |
| 12 | Multi-person conflict behaviour | **Operational Trust** | *My calendar* resolves through the requestor's association, never through room occupancy |
| 13 | Failure behaviour | **DL-41** | No association, or a broken reference → capability unavailable, dependency named. A dangling reference *is reported, never silently rendered as though the source record never existed* |
| 14 | What must never happen | — | **HTBW storing credentials, tokens, calendar contents, or mailbox contents**; or resolving *my calendar* by guessing from who is in the room |

## The four-line claim, corrected

| Proposed line | Verdict |
|---|---|
| *Identity establishes who is engaging* | **Supported** |
| *Continuity reconnects the person to the governed personal context* | **Not yet governed.** No document assigns this to Continuity — **OD-77** |
| *Operational Trust determines whether the resource may be accessed or disclosed* | **Supported** |
| *Concierge consumes that context to fulfil an appropriate request* | **Supported** |

## Acceptance scenarios

| # | Given | Then | Must not |
|---|---|---|---|
| 6.1 | Tom asks for *my calendar* | The association resolves from the **requestor** | Resolve from room occupancy |
| 6.2 | A person leaves the household | The association is revocable and its removal is recorded | Leave an orphaned association resolving silently |
| 6.3 | A guest asks | Household-neutral context only | Inherit any resident association |
| 6.4 | The integration is removed | Broken-reference state is reported | Render the capability as though it still worked |

## Implementation status and unresolved decisions

**U / F**. **OD-77** is the governing decision. Dependent: **OD-06** consent experience, **OD-09**
portability and erasure, **DL-69** (resolved **OD-62**) governed conversational retrieval.

# Use Case 7 — The Morning Calendar Rhythm

## Human outcome

Tom makes coffee most mornings and asks for the day's calendar. Eventually the home offers first —
but only because Tom said it could.

## Ownership map

| # | Question | Owner | Statement |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Authoritative Truth inputs | **Truth** | Presence in the Living Space; time of day |
| 2 | Identity requirements | **Identity** | *An observation may be attributed to a person only where identity confidence meets the threshold. Below it, the evidence is room-scoped or discarded, never guessed* |
| 3 | Consent and Operational Trust requirements | **Operational Trust** | Whether the context may be used at all, and whether an unsolicited offer is an acceptable interruption (**OD-51**) |
| 4 | What Continuity supplies | **Continuity** | **The approved preference — not the observations.** The observation that produced the suggestion is a **Domain Event owned by the responsibility that observed it** |
| 5 | Memory scope | **Person-scoped** or **room-scoped** — *learning respects this split rather than replacing it* | **A** |
| 6 | Source of record | Home Assistant for native activity (**DL-46**); Continuity for the approved preference | **A** |
| 7 | Who decides | **Concierge** | Whether, when, and how to offer |

| 11 | Guest and Unknown Person behaviour | **DL-33**, **OD-65** | An Unknown Person's interactions *are never eligible evidence for person-scoped learning* |
| 12 | Multi-person conflict behaviour | **Operational Trust** | An offer in a shared room is an audience-evaluated Communication |

| 14 | What must never happen | — | **Silent promotion.** *An observed pattern must not silently become an autonomous policy* (**P26**, **DL-21**) |

## Is *"the home learned the routine"* valid public language?

**Only with qualification.** The accurate public sentence is:

> *"The home noticed the pattern, asked whether you wanted it, and does it because you said yes."*

Saying *the home learned* without the acceptance step describes a system this architecture explicitly
prohibits. The full ladder is in
[../architecture/behavioral-governance.md](../architecture/behavioral-governance.md), and
[why-did-this-happen.md](why-did-this-happen.md) Scenarios 16 and 18 are the canonical worked pair:
Scenario 16 — *nothing changes automatically*; Scenario 18 — *a person with authority accepted it*.

## Acceptance scenarios

| # | Given | Then | Must not |
|---|---|---|---|
| 7.1 | A pattern is observed | Nothing behavioural happens | Write a preference |
| 7.2 | A suggestion is made and accepted | It becomes a versioned, revocable Continuity preference | Store it as a separate learned-preference store |
| 7.3 | The offer is repeatedly dismissed | The pattern is itself reportable | Keep offering unchanged and unrecorded |
| 7.4 | Identity is below threshold that morning | Room-scoped evidence, or none | Attribute the observation to Tom |

## Implementation status and unresolved decisions

**F**. **OD-28** lifecycle, **OD-65** evidence eligibility, **OD-63** attribution, **OD-64** native
observation, **OD-51** interruption.

# Use Case 8 — Maisey's Care Continuity

## Human outcome

Maisey's medication, vet visits, and follow-ups are not forgotten, and the reminder arrives the way
the household wants to receive it.

## The boundary this use case exists to protect

| Element | Owner | Not |
|---|---|---|
| That Maisey's care matters, and what caring means | **The household declares; Stewardship represents** | Not Continuity |
| The medication schedule and its obligation state | **Stewardship** | Not Continuity |
| Medication-reminder, veterinary, and follow-up **history** | **Stewardship** | Not Continuity |
| **Preferred delivery, preferred presentation, re-presentation** | **Continuity** | Not Stewardship |
| Whether the reminder may be delivered here, now, to this audience | **Operational Trust** | — |
| Whether it is delivered, and how it is said | **Concierge** | — |

**Stewardship history is Stewardship's**, under the shared temporal model — *each responsibility owns
the history of its own records*. **Continuity may consume it; Continuity does not become its owner.**
Equally, **no general preference, Follow-Me, resume, transfer, or experience restoration moves into
Stewardship.**

**A Pet is not a Person and is not an Asset.** See [../models/asset.md](../models/asset.md) and
[stewardship-use-cases.md](stewardship-use-cases.md) Use Case 2.

| 13 | Failure behaviour | **Stewardship** | *Absence of evidence is never compliance*; `unknown` is never `met` |

| 8.1 | A dose is due | A Stewardship obligation exists | Model it as a Continuity resume candidate |
| 8.2 | The reminder is dismissed | The obligation remains open | Close it (**OD-75**) |

# Use Case 9 — Artwork Caretaker Notification

## Human outcome

Conditions in the Den drift outside the watercolour's declared limits, and the right person hears
about it in the right way.

## Ownership map

| # | Question | Owner | Statement |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Authoritative Truth inputs | **Truth** | Den temperature, humidity, illuminance — with confidence, provenance, and freshness |
| 2 | Identity requirements | **Identity** | Required for the person-directed Communication, not for the assessment |
| 3 | Consent and Operational Trust requirements | **Operational Trust** | Which channel, which audience, and what may be disclosed |
| 4 | What Continuity supplies | **Continuity** | The caretaker's preferred delivery and presentation, and re-presentation if they move |
| 5 | Memory scope | **Person-scoped** preference only | **A** |
| 6 | Source of record | **Foundation** for the Asset and its declared limits; **Stewardship** for significance and caretaker assignment; **Truth** for conditions | **A** |
| 7 | Who decides | **Concierge** | — |

| 9 | Explainability | **Decision Trace** | Asset limit → Truth Fact → obligation → authority → action |
| 10 | Retention and lifecycle | **DL-47** | Obligation history is Stewardship's |
| 11 | Guest and Unknown Person behaviour | **Operational Trust** | Asset value and location are sensitive |
| 12 | Multi-person conflict behaviour | **Stewardship** | The escalation ladder decides who is next (**OD-22**) |
| 13 | Failure behaviour | **DL-41** | A missing sensor makes the assessment `unknown`, never `met` |
| 14 | What must never happen | — | **Continuity supplying the significance, the limit, or the caretaker.** Those are Stewardship's and Foundation's |

This use case is deliberately thin on the Continuity side. **That thinness is the finding**: the full
walkthrough already exists as [stewardship-use-cases.md](stewardship-use-cases.md) Use Case 1, and
Continuity's entire contribution is *how the caretaker prefers to be told*.

# Use Case 10 — Irrigation and Weather

## Human outcome

The garden is watered responsibly, and skipped cycles are explainable.

## The correction this use case records

The proposed narration assigned to Continuity: *last watering event, watering history, soil-moisture
history, recent rainfall, weather observations, seasonal patterns, prior outcomes, relevant care
history.*

**This is contradicted by accepted architecture.**
[stewardship-use-cases.md](stewardship-use-cases.md) Use Case 7 ownership map row 11 reads:

> | 11 | Continuity interaction | **None** | — |

and row 12:

> | 12 | Retention | **DL-47** | Obligation and decision history; **weather Facts are Truth's Historical Facts** |

| Element | Correct owner |
|---|---|
| Rainfall, forecast, soil-moisture observations, and their history | **Truth**, as Facts and Historical Facts |
| The watering requirement and whether it is satisfied | **Stewardship** |
| Watering-event and outcome history | **Stewardship** obligation and care history, plus Home Assistant's own automation activity (**DL-46**) |
| Municipal or household water restriction | **Operational Trust** — *a prohibition, not a preference to be weighed* |
| The recommendation candidate | A permitted **Reasoning Provider**, which *owns nothing* — **OD-67** |
| Whether to offer, and how it is worded | **Concierge** |
| Opening the valve | The **irrigation controller integration, automation, or schedule**. *Stewardship never opens a valve* |
| Preferred delivery of the offer | **Continuity** |

**Continuity's role in this scenario is the delivery preference and nothing more.**

## What must never happen

| Prohibition | Basis |
|---|---|
| Inferring soil condition from rainfall | *No unsupported soil inference. Absent a moisture sensor, the home does not know whether the ground is wet* |
| Stewardship owning, fetching, or caching weather | *Stewardship does not own weather truth, and does not fetch a forecast* |
| An LLM becoming the authority for plant care | *A reasoning provider owns nothing… its output never silently becomes a Fact, and its recommendation never silently becomes an authorised action* |
| A recommendation becoming an authorisation | *Operational Trust owns permission. A recommendation never silently becomes an authorised action* |
| Watering automatically without household authorisation | The autonomy ceiling is Operational Trust's |
| Presenting a fallback decision as a weather-informed one | Acceptance scenario 7.7 |

## Where plant-care knowledge belongs

| Candidate framing | Verdict |
|---|---|
| Ephemeral AI output | **Permitted, but authoritative for nothing.** Retained as *the consultation record, and the decision that accepted it* ([../models/temporal-record.md](../models/temporal-record.md)) |
| A reviewed household care profile | **The architecture-faithful home** — the household **declares** the care expectation; Stewardship represents it |
| Governed external knowledge owned by HTBW | **Not governed.** HTBW defines no plant-care knowledge base and none is created here |

**Deterministic environmental logic is sufficient for the obligation. AI assistance is optional,
replaceable, and never load-bearing** — removing it degrades phrasing, never correctness.

## Implementation status and unresolved decisions

**F**. **OD-63** attribution, **OD-64** native automation as governed executor evidence, **OD-67**
reasoning-provider strategy, **OD-75** *satisfied without action* versus *performed*.

# Use Case 11 — Music, Book, and Television Recommendation Candidates

## Human outcome

Suggestions that feel like they know the household, without the household feeling watched.

## Ownership map

| # | Question | Owner | Statement |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Authoritative Truth inputs | **Truth** | Who is present, and what is playing now |
| 2 | Identity requirements | **Identity** | Person-scoped observation requires a sufficient assertion; otherwise room-scoped or discarded |

| 4 | What Continuity supplies | **Continuity** | Person-scoped preferred artist, genre, album, playlist; room-scoped last song and last genre; experience history |
| 5 | Memory scope | The **preserved scoping rule** — taste is a property of the person; volume is a property of the room | **A** |
| 6 | Source of record | **The content provider** remains authoritative for playback history and its own recommendations (**P21**, **DL-46**) | **A** |
| 7 | Who decides | **Concierge** | Whether, when, and how to present |
| 8 | Who executes | **Concierge** | — |
| 9 | Explainability | **Decision Trace** | Why this was suggested, and on what evidence |
| 10 | Retention and lifecycle | **OD-26**, **DL-47** | Experience-history scope and duration are open |
| 11 | Guest and Unknown Person behaviour | **DL-33** | No person-scoped learning from an Unknown Person; guests must not see residents' preferences or history |
| 12 | Multi-person conflict behaviour | **Operational Trust** | Shared viewing is not personal viewing; a recommendation before guests is an audience-evaluated disclosure |
| 13 | Failure behaviour | **DL-41** | Provider or reasoning-provider unavailable → the capability is unavailable and says so |
| 14 | What must never happen | — | **Continuity recommending anything.** *Continuity feeds Concierge; Continuity does not choose* |

## Where each proposed element actually sits

| Proposed element | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Preferred artist, genre, album, playlist | **Continuity**, person-scoped | **A** |
| Last song, last genre, music/duck/TTS volume | **Continuity**, room-scoped | **A** |
| Completion, skip, abandonment, engagement observations | **Domain Events**, owned by the responsibility that observed them; native media activity stays with Home Assistant (**DL-46**) | **E** |
| Correlating observations into candidates | A permitted intelligence, under **OD-28** / **OD-65** / **OD-67** | **U** |
| Presenting the recommendation | **Concierge** | **A** |
| Accidental playback, preference correction, feedback, expiry | **OD-28**, **OD-65** | **U** |

## Acceptance scenarios

| # | Given | Then | Must not |
|---|---|---|---|
| 11.1 | A guest plays something | It is not eligible person-scoped evidence | Attribute it to a resident |
| 11.2 | A track was played by accident | Correction is possible | Treat one play as a preference |
| 11.3 | A candidate exists but was never accepted | The home may **offer** | Apply it as a policy |
| 11.4 | The provider offers its own recommendations | The provider remains authoritative for them | Present a provider recommendation as an HTBW conclusion |

# Use Case 12 — Household Traditions

## Human outcome

The Sunday dinner lighting, the holiday scene, the welcome-home moment — the things that make a house
feel like this household's home.

## The honest finding

**The repository says nothing about traditions, rituals, celebrations, or household culture.** A
repository-wide search returns no match for *tradition* or *ritual* in any canonical document.

**Nothing is created here to fill that silence.** What the architecture *does* already provide:

| Narrative idea | Nearest accepted construct | Status |
|---|---|---|
| A recurring shared moment | An **Experience** — *a coherent household-facing activity that can be started, transferred, resumed, suppressed, or ended* | **A** |
| An authored household routine | A household-owned Home Assistant scene, script, or automation. *The household owns this behaviour through Home Assistant. HTBW owns none of it* | **A** |
| A repeated occurrence noticed by the home | A **Pattern** on the promotion ladder — *nothing behavioural* | **A** |
| *The home decided this is now a tradition* | **Prohibited** | **P26**, **DL-21** |

**The risk the narration must not take:** a repeated event is a pattern, not a meaning. Deciding that
a recurrence *matters* is a **household declaration**, and *Stewardship never decides on the
household's behalf that something matters*. The same rule protects traditions.

Household agency, transparency, editability, expiry, and explainability are therefore already
required — through the promotion ladder, **OD-28**, and **DL-47** — without a tradition model.

**Status: `N` — not governed, and legitimately narratable only as a future possibility.**

# Use Case 13 — Correction, Revocation, Expiration, and Deletion

## Human outcome

The home learned the wrong thing, and Tom can fix it — and the fix is itself explainable.

## Ownership map

| # | Question | Owner | Statement |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Authoritative Truth inputs | **Truth** | Not engaged. Correcting a preference is not correcting a Fact |
| 2 | Identity requirements | **Identity** | Correcting a person-scoped preference requires authority over it |
| 3 | Consent and Operational Trust requirements | **Operational Trust** | Owns retention policy, privacy policy, and **Preservation Hold** authority |
| 4 | What Continuity supplies | **Continuity** | The preference, its version history, and its revocability |
| 5 | Memory scope | Whatever scope the record already had | **A** |
| 6 | Source of record | Each responsibility, for its own records | **A** |
| 7 | Who decides | The **household** | Correction is a household right, not a system judgement |
| 8 | Who executes | The owning responsibility | — |
| 9 | Explainability | **Decision Trace** | *A correction must not overwrite prior history. A correction is a new Change Record* |
| 10 | Retention and lifecycle | **DL-47** | *Every governed record class declares its retention.* *"Undecided" is not a retention strategy* |
| 11 | Guest and Unknown Person behaviour | **DL-33** | There is nothing to correct; an Unknown Person holds nothing |
| 12 | Multi-person conflict behaviour | **Operational Trust** | Who may correct whose preference is an authority question |
| 13 | Failure behaviour | **P30** | A Decision Trace references the **exact version** used, so a past explanation stays accurate after the preference changed |
| 14 | What must never happen | — | **Overwriting history to make the present tidy**; deleting a record under Preservation Hold |

## The memory classes, and who owns each

This is the distinction the narration needs and the repository had not stated in one place:

| Class | Owner | Lifecycle |
|---|---|---|
| **Current operational memory** — what is wanted, what is running | **Continuity**, as a Current Projection | Replaced rather than retained (**DL-47**) |
| **Historical evidence** — what was observed | The responsibility that observed it, as **Domain Events** | External History Retention |
| **Historical Fact** — what was true then | **Truth** | Truth-owned history; *never presented as current or actionable* |
| **Learned preference** — an accepted proposal | **Continuity**, versioned and revocable | **OD-28** |
| **Inferred pattern** — not yet accepted | Not a preference and not a store | *Nothing behavioural* |
| **Authored household policy** | **Operational Trust** | Policy version history |
| **External source reference** | A **Governed Reference**; the source keeps the content | Broken references are reported, never silently hidden |
| **Source-owned content** — calendar entries, mail, playback position | **The provider** | HTBW *persists no second copy merely to explain later* (**DL-46**) |
| **Derived recommendation** | Nobody owns it as truth. *A reasoning provider owns nothing* | Retained as the consultation record and the decision that accepted it |
| **Retained explanation artifact** — the Decision Trace | **Concierge** | External History Retention, unless a floor or Preservation Hold applies (**DL-47**, **OD-05**, **OD-29**) |

## Why Continuity cannot become a data lake

Three accepted rules do this work, and no fourth is needed:

1. **DL-46** — Home Assistant retains native activity; HTBW retains only the governed meaning Home
   Assistant does not represent, **by reference rather than copy**.
2. **DL-47** — every governed record class declares its retention, or it is not accepted.
3. **P22 / connected storage** — *connected storage never becomes a shadow system of record for
   something Home Assistant already owns authoritatively.*

## Acceptance scenarios

| # | Given | Then | Must not |
|---|---|---|---|
| 13.1 | Tom corrects a learned preference | A new Change Record; the old version remains referenceable | Overwrite the prior value |
| 13.2 | Tom revokes a preference | The adaptive policy stops; past actions remain explainable | Erase the trace that explained them |
| 13.3 | A retention ceiling is reached | The record expires per its class | Apply one retention rule across all classes |
| 13.4 | A Preservation Hold applies | Normal purge is blocked | Treat the hold as a legal claim |
| 13.5 | Deletion and a retention floor conflict | **Unresolved — OD-36** | Resolve it by preference |

# Use Case 14 — Guests, Unknown People, and Multi-Person Conflict

## Human outcome

Nobody's private context leaks, and nobody is guessed at.

## The accepted rules, restated in one place

| Rule | Basis |
|---|---|
| **Unknown Person is a valid outcome**, and never a native Person | **DL-33** |
| An Unknown Person *owns no preferences or history, inherits nothing from any resident, generates no person-scoped learning, and grants nothing* | **DL-33** |
| Unknown Person access defaults to **household-neutral context** | **DL-33** |
| *Guests must not see residents' preferences or history* | Continuity model and contract, privacy constraints |
| **Participation is optional and requires consent**; consent *gates eligibility, not weight* | [../architecture/privacy.md](../architecture/privacy.md) |
| An observation is attributed to a person only where confidence meets the threshold; below it, **room-scoped or discarded, never guessed** | [../architecture/behavioral-governance.md](../architecture/behavioral-governance.md) |
| Displacing another person's session requires **authority granted by Operational Trust** | [../models/experience-and-session.md](../models/experience-and-session.md) |
| Two sessions claiming one Room are **surfaced to Concierge, never merged or terminated unilaterally** | Continuity contract |
| Audience composition is a first-class input, and **disclosure is separate from knowledge** | **DL-34**, **P32** |

## Unresolved

**OD-24** session merge · **OD-27** concurrency · **OD-52** audience specification · **OD-71** audience
uncertainty · **OD-72** unknown-actor correlation confidence.

# Use Case 15 — Explaining What Was Remembered

## Human outcome

*"Why did you do that?"* has an answer, every time — including *"I can't tell you."*

## What the home can say

| Situation | The home says |
|---|---|
| A remembered room value was applied | *"I set it to the level this room normally uses."* |
| An accepted preference was applied | *"You accepted this in March, so I applied it. You can pause or remove it."* |
| A transfer was suppressed | *"I did not move the music into the Primary Bedroom, because the room is in Nighttime mode."* |
| A preference could not be read | *"I could not read your preference for this, so I did not guess."* |
| A dependency is missing | *"I can't do that — no calendar is connected."* |
| A provider acted on its own | *"The adaptive lighting integration changed this. I don't hold its reasoning."* |
| Nothing supports a cause | *"It changed at 7:42, and I can't tell you what caused it."* |

## The rules behind those sentences

| Rule | Basis |
|---|---|
| Every transfer, suppression, resume offer, and refusal records intent, eligibility outcome, blocking reason, and the responsibility that supplied it | Continuity contract |
| **A suppressed transfer must be explainable as a deliberate outcome, not as a failure** | Continuity contract |
| Each block is a **reason**, and each reason must reach the Decision Trace | Continuity model |
| A Decision Trace references the **exact version** of the preference or session it used | **P30**, **DL-27** |
| **The unknown answer is a correct answer** | [why-did-this-happen.md](why-did-this-happen.md) Scenario 21 |
| *Converting temporal proximity into asserted causation* is prohibited | [why-did-this-happen.md](why-did-this-happen.md) Scenario 21 |
| Whether this listener may receive this answer is **Operational Trust's** | **DL-34**; visibility is **OD-30**; retrieval is **DL-69** (resolved **OD-62**) |
