# Open Decision Issue Index

## Purpose

**GitHub issues are the authoritative source for the current status, remaining questions,
dependencies, and closure evidence of open architecture decisions.**

**Repository architecture documents remain authoritative for accepted architecture.**

This index is the bridge between the two. It records, for every open decision, only what a governance
document should carry: identifier, title, status, the canonical issue link, a dependency summary, and
the accepted or superseding authority. **It does not restate the issue.** The issue holds the
architectural context, the remaining questions, the options, the acceptance criteria, and the exit
criteria.

Accepted decisions — **DL-01** through **DL-52** — are closed and binding, are recorded in
[decision-ledger.md](decision-ledger.md) Part 1, and are **not** tracked as issues.

Repository: `tom-tagmdl/homes_that_behave_well`.

## Governance backlog Epic

| Item | Issue |
|---|---|
| **HTBW Architecture and Governance Backlog — Authoritative Open Decisions** | **#147** |

The Epic carries the reconstruction record, the dependency map, the recommended work sequence, the
backlog maintenance rules, and the closure criteria.

## Open decisions

Status values are those held on the issue. Where a decision is blocked, the blocking issue is named.

## Closed and resolved decisions

**Preserved, never recreated, never reopened.** Recorded here so that a reader who finds one of these
identifiers in an older document can see immediately that it is settled.

| ID | Disposition |
|---|---|
| **OD-02** | Closed — DL-43, DL-44, DL-45 |
| **OD-03** | Closed — DL-42, DL-44, DL-45 |
| **OD-08** | Closed — DL-39, DL-40. Per-class defaults deferred to **OD-51** |
| **OD-75** | Closed — **DL-48**, **DL-49**. Obligation condition and lifecycle separated; Care Evidence Record accepted; custody resolved as a Stewardship-owned Custody Period. **Formal acceptance review completed 2026-08-20, result PASS; issue #105 closed as the completed governance record** |
| **OD-14** | Resolved — native naming is an input, never an authority, and is never written back |
| **OD-16** | Resolved — accepted as **DL-38**, the Identity Fusion Function |
| **OD-33** | Closed — DL-43, DL-46, DL-47. Values held by **OD-05**, **OD-26**, **OD-49** |
| **OD-34** | Closed — DL-42, DL-44, DL-46, DL-47. Mechanism residual retained in **OD-01** |
| **OD-50** | Resolved — one escalation architecture. Residual is **OD-22** |
| **OD-80** | Closed — **DL-50**. A capability may declare an execution host; Wyoming is the preferred voice-pipeline boundary; a provider reports candidates and Identity alone resolves. Residuals separated as **OD-82** and **OD-83**. **OD-07** and **OD-66** are not resolved by it |
| **OD-82** | Closed — **DL-51**, **DL-52**. **Product disposition is stated per product**: Asset Intelligence remains a released standalone integration, **is not retired**, and **HTBW must never require it to be installed**; the standalone Voice Identity and Concierge integrations **sunset** while Identity and Concierge remain first-class responsibilities. **Adoption is one-time, authoritative, and terminating.** The non-negotiable constraint in [authority-order.md](authority-order.md) was **amended, not deleted**, and the canonical contradiction across `authority-order.md`, `greenfield-mandate.md`, `north-star.md`, and `adr-htbw-core-refoundation.md` is reconciled. Residual separated as **OD-85**. **OD-20** is narrowed but not closed |
| **OD-43** | Closed — **DL-53**. A Delivery Surface declares capability dimensions and Potential Perceptibility and never declares itself private. A supplied **Recipient-Attribution Assurance Levels** scale was found to duplicate **DL-40** and was resolved by reuse rather than a second scale. Residuals separated as **OD-52**, **OD-55**, **OD-57**, **OD-71**, and **OD-73** |
| **OD-55** | Closed — **DL-54**. Presentation Outcome is exactly Presented / Failed / Unknown / Attestation Unavailable, evaluated by modality and evidence, never device class. Per-surface Home Assistant evidence recorded in the ADR. Residual runtime multi-provider/multi-endpoint questions separated as **OD-88** |
| **OD-88** | Closed — **DL-55**. Governance-harvest result: execution-provider selection, endpoint identity, device-interaction/workflow boundary, and capability evolution all reduced to existing owners (Room Configuration, Asset model, DL-53, DL-41); only a narrow room-level outcome projection over DL-54 was new |
| **OD-06** | Closed — **DL-56**. Consent is required for person association, never environmental observation alone; Person Setup is the capture/review experience; self/proxy consent, withdrawal/deletion, and the DL-43/DL-47 reconciliation are accepted. Residual proxy-authority qualification separated to **OD-76**; exceptional legal/incident correlation separated to **OD-89** |
| **OD-76** | Closed — **DL-57**. Delegated Stewardship authority is an explicit, scoped **Delegated Access Grant**, never inferred from a relationship, Role, or administrator status; self/proxy/capacity model accepted; identity evidence never transfers with a grant; non-resident authorized participants may hold a minimal Person record; revocation is immediate and prospective; OD-22 escalation applies only to a configured accountability change, not ordinary incomplete-obligation notification. Scope boundary against **OD-77** honoured, not absorbed |
| **OD-74** | Closed — **DL-58**. Truth Fact Confidence is a strength-of-evidentiary-support ordinal band (Low < Moderate < High < Very High), one uniform enumeration across every Fact Subject and class, structurally separate from **DL-39** Identity Confidence and never converted, averaged, or compared against it. Independent of freshness (**OD-18**), provenance, and coverage (**OD-17**); an optional numeric is a non-authoritative ordering value only. **OD-17**, **OD-18**, **OD-19**, and **OD-72** updated with the boundary; none closed by this decision |
| **OD-18** | Closed — **DL-59**. Truth distinguishes Current-State Sources from Point-in-Time Observation Sources; current-state Facts read the most current authoritative Home Assistant state at evaluation time (never an HTBW-imposed delay); operational expiration is a **DL-25** lifecycle transition via the existing Domain Event mechanism; **DL-58** Truth Confidence is never decayed by elapsed time alone; on-demand refresh is bounded by per-integration **DL-30** verification, never manufacturing a physical observation; freshness/validity windows are household configuration, not architecture. Contextual Person-Presence multi-evidence combination, person-specific evidence reliability, cross-purpose assertion eligibility, and person-associated-device conflicts were identified as already-owned (**DL-38**) or routed as evidence to **OD-15** and **OD-19**, never decided here |
| **OD-61** | Closed — **DL-60**. Room Configuration defines an extensible Room Environment Standard; a native Area environmental slot seeds a default proposal (never automatic, never overriding an explicit selection/exclusion, never written back), mirroring **OD-14**; multiple same-purpose sources are disambiguated as Primary Authority / Secondary / Composite Contributor / Excluded at the time of this decision, later narrowed to three states by **DL-62**; one configuration serves both direct questions and composite/care derivations; Merged Rooms surface constituent-Room-scoped candidates; derived purposes (e.g. dew point) are Truth-computed Formula-Derived Facts. **OD-17**, since closed as **DL-62**, resolved the aggregation question; **OD-19**, since closed as **DL-63**, resolved the conflict question. A Concierge implementation conflict ("Room Confidence"/"People Health" labels) against the already-accepted no-synthetic-health prohibition was found and routed to **OD-69**, not fixed here |
| **OD-69** | Closed — **DL-61**. Asset-derived Entity projection reuses Stewardship's and Truth's existing owned vocabularies, never an invented health scale. Person Environmental Requirements reuse the Asset environmental-limit pattern through Person Setup, evaluated by Stewardship against current Room Environment Facts only while a valid Contextual Person-Presence Fact applies; Environmental Coverage, Configuration Completeness, and Truth Confidence are kept as three separate measures; Room Environmental Status is a non-authoritative projection; Room Health, Room Confidence, and People Health are formally rejected as authoritative terms. The Concierge implementation conflict remains unfixed, reaffirmed as out-of-scope implementation remediation |
| **OD-17** | Closed — **DL-62**. Ordinary Room Environment measurements never aggregate equivalent same-purpose sensors: Room Configuration selects one required **Primary Authority** per Environmental Purpose, identically for a Physical Room and a Merged Room; Truth reads its current state as an Authority-Derived Fact with no contributor coverage. **Composite Contributor is removed** from the ordinary path, narrowing **DL-60**'s disambiguation to Primary Authority / Secondary-Corroborating / Explicit Exclusion; a future narrow same-purpose aggregation use case, if ever accepted, is satisfied by Home Assistant's native Min/Max helper rather than a new HTBW engine. **Formula-Derived Fact governance is accepted** (input availability, provenance, versioning, failure semantics): Dew Point's formula class/versioning is ready; Mold Index and Condensation Risk remain unresolved, with no HTBW-endorsed formula invented. Environmental Coverage, Configuration Completeness, and Room Environmental Stewardship Summary remain **DL-61**'s |
| **OD-19** | Closed — **DL-63**. A genuine Truth conflict exists only when two or more currently eligible, semantically comparable claims for the same Subject/predicate/context/time remain incompatible after Truth's fixed qualification order (Subject → predicate → context → time/validity → availability (**DL-41**) → **DL-59** validity → configuration eligibility → consent/policy → authority selection → semantic comparability → contradiction → outcome) and no accepted authority/validity/availability/configuration/Identity/Stewardship rule already explains the difference. **Same-purpose environmental sensor disagreement (DL-62), native Area proposal divergence (DL-60), Provider-Derived Environmental Indicators (post-DL-62 clarification), and Person/Pet/Asset requirement conflicts (DL-61) are confirmed as not Truth conflicts.** Identity contradiction remains **DL-38**'s; assertion lifetime and cross-purpose eligibility remain **OD-15**'s, consumed without redefinition. Truth publishes a reduced-confidence Fact, an unresolved Fact, or `unknown` under a versioned Fact-class **Conflict Policy**; no range-valued Fact is adopted; universal provenance-class precedence is rejected; persistent conflict is recorded through the existing Domain Event mechanism and evaluated against **OD-60**'s Repairs criteria separately from the runtime outcome |
| **OD-15** | Closed — **DL-64**. "Assertion lifetime" was a conflation of **Assertion Validity** (a permanent historical record, **DL-47**-governed retention only), **Current-Interaction Applicability** (re-evaluated per interaction via fresh **DL-38** fusion from current eligible evidence — no fixed window, no new event, condition-bounded), and **Retention** (already **DL-47**'s, unaffected). No Assertion Purpose requires a fixed validity window; Fusion Policy's existing per-source freshness/hard-cutoff mechanism is sufficient. **Cross-purpose assertion eligibility is accepted**: a prior purpose-specific Assertion's contribution to a later different-purpose determination ends when the supporting Room's occupancy transitions to `unoccupied` or the Person's configured primary evidence source leaves that Room. Applicability is evaluated before **DL-63**'s conflict qualification ever runs |
| **OD-60** | Closed — **DL-65**. Repairs is a **projection** of an HTBW-owned, authoritative Defect State — never the reverse — verified directly against official Home Assistant Repairs documentation (an integration creates/deletes its own issues; ignoring never deletes or resolves one). Genuine Repairs candidates: missing/invalid **DL-41** capability dependencies, broken governed references, and configuration invariants ordinary runtime evaluation cannot resolve (e.g. duplicate Primary Authority). Configuration divergence (native-vs-HTBW), Provider-Derived Indicator values, Stewardship obligations, Truth runtime outcomes, and Identity Assertion outcomes are confirmed never automatically Repairs-eligible. `severity` maps only from Home Assistant's own three-value `IssueSeverity`, driven by each owning responsibility's already-accepted state, never Stewardship significance or Operational Trust Urgency. Ignoring never changes HTBW's Defect State; re-raising reuses each responsibility's own existing state-evaluation trigger — no new timer or event model |
| **OD-59** | Closed — **DL-66**. Native Assist exposure (a Home Assistant platform **safety boundary** on voice targeting) and HTBW Exposure (Room Configuration's own governed household-facing availability decision, **DL-11**) are not the same concept. For voice/conversation-mediated interaction, HTBW Exposure may narrow but never exceed native Assist exposure, and never writes back to it — a narrower rule than **OD-14**/**DL-60**'s "native seeds a proposal" pattern, because Assist exposure is a deliberate safety precondition, not an informational suggestion. Non-voice surfaces (a UI panel, a dashboard) are independently governed by Room Configuration, unbound by a voice-specific native setting. Ordinary divergence between the two is never a defect and never Repairs-eligible (**DL-65**) — every scenario resolves through the precedence rule without administrator intervention. **OD-62** consumes this boundary without redefining it. The specific native read/observe mechanism remains a **DL-30** implementation-time verification, mirroring **DL-60**'s own per-slot precedent, not an architectural blocker |
| **OD-11** | Closed — **DL-67**. A Merged Room is a curated **conversational interaction context** — the same Room contract Foundation and Room Configuration already define, applied to more than one Physical Room — never a general-purpose or capability-specific grouping mechanism. **A Physical Room may participate in at most one Merged Room at a time**, confirmed against **DL-13**'s rejection of special-case orchestration (overlapping membership would force every Room-Context consumer to invent its own selection rule) and against real Concierge implementation evidence (composite configuration already structurally excludes an Area already in one enabled composite from another, and already carries conversational-context properties — persona, TTS voice/language, AI knowledge enablement — rather than generic grouping properties). A household's desire for a broader or different grouping ("Downstairs lights") is met by Home Assistant's own native Floor/Area targeting, never by an overlapping Merged Room. No double-counting is structurally possible, and movement between non-overlapping Merged Rooms remains an ordinary **DL-13** transfer |
| **OD-70** | Closed — **DL-68**. **ACCEPTED, NO NATIVE REPRESENTATION.** A Merged Room is an HTBW-owned, curated interaction and vocabulary context (**DL-67**); a consumer inventory (dashboards, native automations, Assist/Conversation, native targeting, scripts, scenes, labels, groups, administrative views, external integrations) found no canonical, implemented consumer requiring a native projection. Area is rejected (no native "Area of Areas" concept; second physical-topology-authority risk); Floor is rejected for this purpose (already reserved for native physical hierarchy, which independently satisfies the broader-grouping need per **DL-67**); Group is rejected as a representation (carries targets, never vocabulary/interaction context, though Concierge's own execution may still use one internally per **DL-31**/**DL-55**); Scene is rejected (a Merged Room's outcome may resolve to a Scene, but is never one). **Assist/Conversation must never receive a native Merged Room projection** — not only because none is needed, but because one would let the built-in conversation agent bypass HTBW's curated vocabulary, participation, exclusions, and **DL-66** Exposure narrowing. Label is not adopted (no proven consumer; label-management API unverified, matching **OD-68**'s own unresolved finding — not decided or preempted here). Constituent removal uses the existing broken-reference/Repairs model (**DL-31**, **DL-65**) without a new rule. The scene-controller metaphor is memorialized as explanatory, not new architecture. Command-routing, no-match, and native-fallback requirements (including the Bedtime failure) are explicitly not decided here and are routed to **OD-62** as evidence |
| **OD-62** | Closed — **DL-69**. Scope amended, at the architecture-owner's direction, from retrieval-only to **retrieval and command resolution**. **Vocabulary is accepted as a first-class HTBW concept** under existing Foundation/Room Configuration ownership (no new responsibility), context-typed (Physical Room, Merged Room, Person, Household, Capability, Interaction) with a tested precedence order that excludes a Household-wide inherited tier (left to **OD-13**). A unified, Merged-Room-aware (**DL-67**, **DL-68**) command-resolution sequence is accepted, ending in native execution with fallback considered only afterward and only where safe. **A failed HTBW vocabulary match must never silently authorize an unrelated or materially broader native action** (resolves the "Bedtime" scenario). Vocabulary cardinality is configuration, never English morphology; the existing `ambiguous` state (Contextual Vocabulary Contract) is confirmed to already cover singular-versus-configured-member-level clarification once member-level terms exist. Conversational retrieval classes are enumerated with pre-answer filtering (never post-hoc redaction); historical reconstruction remains excluded to **OD-35**. An honest response vocabulary extends the existing governed fallback vocabulary. Decision Trace requirements are extended. Every Home Assistant Voice claim was checked against official developer documentation; no undocumented confidence score, transcript alternative, or metadata is assumed |
| **OD-13** | Closed — **DL-70**. Four Vocabulary scopes accepted: **Home (Global), Room, Merged Room, Person**. A Physical Room and a Merged Room behave identically once configured; only the setup candidate pool differs (**DL-13**, **DL-67**). A Home-scoped term is inherited everywhere no narrower term exists; a Room or Merged Room may **shadow** it (never replace it) — the sixth precedence tier **DL-69** reserved is now filled: active clarification → current Person (Person-owned capability) → exclusive Merged Room → Physical Room → **Home scope** → native fallback. **Vocabulary and Fulfillment are distinguished as separate concerns** (a word may stay Home-scoped and stable while its Fulfillment — provider, target, source — varies by Room, Merged Room, or Person), confirmed against real Concierge implementation evidence. Person Vocabulary stays restricted to Person-owned capabilities and never redefines Room-owned device Vocabulary. Collision behaviour is stated for cross-Room (no collision), same-scope (configuration-invariant violation, **DL-65** Repairs-eligible), Home-vs-Room (shadowing), and Person-vs-Room (valid only for genuinely Person-owned capabilities) cases. Floor participation remains deferred to **OD-10**. The architecture-owner's Asset-engagement "default Guest" proposal is **not decided here** — routed as evidence to **OD-52**. A known Concierge implementation gap (no Home-scope fallback in the current vocabulary resolver) is recorded, not fixed |
| **OD-52** | Closed — **DL-71**. Five Intended Audience Specification forms accepted: **Named Person, Role/Authority Class, Relationship-based, Anyone Present With Authority, Household** — splitting the existing "Caretaker" overlap between a bare Role and a subject-scoped relationship. `caretaker-of` clarified as **many-to-many**, Stewardship as sole assignment authority, Person/subject views as projections over one record set; a bare relationship is never itself access authority (**DL-57**). **"Person Extension"** adopted as a household-facing name for the already-**distributed** ownership **DL-31** requires — no unified store created. **Guest fallback** is exactly one designated existing Person's settings, consulted under **Unknown Person** without any Identity Assertion binding the two (**DL-33** fully preserved); a real Concierge implementation risk (`PreferenceIdentityState.GUEST` as a peer of `KNOWN`/`UNKNOWN`) is flagged, not fixed. **Copy Settings From Person** is setup-only — permissions/Vocabulary/preferences copyable; resources, relationships, consent, and identity evidence never copied; no runtime inheritance; no Role hierarchy created. **One Completion Satisfies All** and **Each Recipient Must Complete** are both already expressible under **DL-48**/**DL-57** — no new Notice object or completion state machine. Escalation (**OD-22**), lifecycle (**OD-44**), acknowledgement (**OD-45**), retention (**OD-49**), retry (**OD-54**), and audience-uncertainty default policy (**OD-71**) all remain their own owners' |

## Maintenance rules

1. **One open decision, one issue.** Never two issues for one decision; never one issue for two
   separately closeable decisions.
2. **Preserve original OD identifiers.** Never reuse a retired one. Never invent a new one unless the
   accepted governance process requires it and the issue genuinely represents a newly discovered
   constitutional decision.
3. **Never reopen a closed decision.** Where a closure left a residual, it is tracked on the open
   decision that owns it, as recorded in the table above.
4. **When a decision closes**, update [decision-ledger.md](decision-ledger.md), update this index,
   update every dependent issue, and tick the item in Epic **#147**.
5. **Never close a decision on an assumption about an unverified platform capability** (**DL-30**).
   Unverifiable documentation leaves the decision open.
6. **A new open decision requires a ledger entry first**, then an issue, then a row here.
7. This index carries **identifier, title, status, issue link, dependency summary, and authority
   only**. The issue carries everything else.
