# Issue Execution Review Checklist

## 1. Purpose

Define the purpose of the Issue Execution Review Checklist.

This document establishes the authoritative E15-G3 execution-review governance baseline used to evaluate issue execution against authoritative sources before issue closure.

This document operationalizes E15-G1 and E15-G2.

This document is architecture and governance only.

This document does not define runtime implementation behavior, platform capabilities, integrations, automation behavior, new architecture, or redefinition of existing architecture.

## 2. Scope Reviewed

Documented review of:

- HTBW #14
- HTBW #16

Review governance authority is established by E15-G1 and operationalized by E15-G2 and E15-G3.

Execution governance authority remains authority-order constrained.

Review ownership remains governance-bound and traceability-driven.

4. escalate with correction recommendation

Result: PASS

## 13. ADR Conflict Workflow

When issue conflicts with ADR:

Result: PASS

## 14. Contract Conflict Workflow

When issue conflicts with Contract:

- do not implement conflicting behavior

Result: PASS

## 15. Model Conflict Workflow

When issue conflicts with Model:

- stop execution immediately

- recommend correction aligned to Model
- do not implement conflicting behavior

Result: PASS

## 16. Existing Implementation Conflict Workflow

When issue conflicts with Existing Implementation:

- stop execution immediately
- document implementation conflict with citation
- document behavioral impact
- recommend correction aligned to authoritative implementation and upstream authority
- do not implement conflicting behavior

Result: PASS

## 17. Review Execution Workflow

Review sequence:

1. Architecture Alignment
2. Contract Alignment
3. Model Alignment
4. Ownership Alignment
5. Existing Implementation Alignment

Validation sequence:

1. validate category evidence
2. validate conflict status
3. validate traceability completeness

Approval sequence:

1. confirm all categories complete
2. confirm no unresolved conflicts
3. confirm closure evidence documented

Result: PASS

## 18. Review Evidence Requirements

Required evidence:

- authoritative source citations for each category

Validation evidence:

- PASS/FAIL outcomes for each category and rule

- explicit mapping from execution to ADR/Contract/Model/Implementation/Issue inputs.

Result: PASS

## 19. Review Documentation Standards

Review documentation expectations:

- structured category-by-category review outputs

## 20. Mandatory Review Checklist Definition

Authoritative reusable review checklist:

```text
Issue Execution Review Checklist

Mandatory Categories:
1. Architecture Alignment
2. Contract Alignment
3. Model Alignment
4. Ownership Alignment
5. Existing Implementation Alignment

For each category:
- list authoritative references reviewed
- record alignment findings
- record PASS/FAIL

Conflict Review:
- document detected conflicts
- document authority-order comparison
- document escalation and correction recommendation

Completion Gate:
- fail review if any category is skipped
- fail review if unresolved conflicts remain
- fail review if traceability evidence is incomplete

Closure Gate:
- approve only when all five categories PASS and evidence is complete
```

Result: PASS

## 21. Review Checklist Example

Evidence: <ADR references>

Contract Alignment: PASS

| Model | Model Alignment evidence required | semantic conformance documented |
| Existing Implementation | Implementation Alignment evidence required | behavior interpretation conformance documented |
