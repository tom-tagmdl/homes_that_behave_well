# Standard Implementation Prompt Header

## 1. Purpose

Define the purpose of the Standard Implementation Prompt Header.

This document establishes the authoritative E15-G2 reusable implementation prompt-header baseline that operationalizes E15-G1 execution governance before any implementation work begins.

This document is architecture and governance only.

This document does not define runtime implementation behavior, platform capabilities, integrations, automation behavior, new architecture, or redefinition of existing architecture.

## 2. Scope Reviewed

Documented review of:

- HTBW #14
- HTBW #16
- HTBW #17
- HTBW #18
- HTBW #20
- HTBW #23
- HTBW #31
- HTBW #39
- HTBW #47
- HTBW #50
- Concierge #176
- E15-G1

Reviewed associated authority surfaces:

- HTBW ADR collection
- HTBW contracts
- HTBW models
- existing implementation authorities
- execution governance artifacts

## 3. Prompt Governance Validation

Validation scope:

- prompt governance authority
- execution governance authority
- review authority

Result: PASS

Prompt governance authority is established by E15-G1 and consumed by this reusable header standard.

Execution governance authority remains grounded in authority-order enforcement.

Review authority remains governance-bound and traceability-driven.

## 4. Authority Order Validation

Authority order:

1. ADR
2. Contract
3. Model

Result: PASS

## 5. Implementation Grounding Sequence Validation

Required grounding sequence:

1. Read ADRs
2. Read Contracts
3. Read Models
4. Read Existing Implementation
5. Read GitHub Issue

Only after all five steps may implementation begin.

Result: PASS

## 6. GitHub Issue Authority Review

1. validate required header sections
2. validate authority-order statements
3. validate grounding sequence statements
4. validate stop-condition statements
5. validate traceability expectations

Result: PASS

## 17. Repository Applicability Review

Applicability scope:

- HTBW
- Concierge
- Voice Identity
- Asset Intelligence
- Future repositories

This prompt-header standard is applicable across all HTBW-governed repositories.

Result: PASS

## 18. Copilot Usage Review

Copilot execution expectations:

- treat GitHub Issues as execution inputs, not architecture authority.

Grounding expectations:

- complete ADR, Contract, Model, Existing Implementation, then GitHub Issue review before implementation.

Authority validation expectations:

- validate authority order and conflicts before execution.

Result: PASS

## 19. Implementation Review Expectations

Implementation review requirements:

- review authority alignment before implementation scope is accepted.

Authority review requirements:

- verify ADR/Contract/Model/Existing Implementation/GitHub Issue sequence completion.

Validation requirements:

- verify conflict checks, stop conditions, and traceability documentation.

Result: PASS

## 20. Standard Prompt Header Definition

Authoritative reusable prompt-header template:

```text
HTBW EXECUTION GROUNDING STANDARD

You are working on the Homes That Behave Well platform.

This is an architecture/governance-grounded implementation task.

Authority order:
1. ADR
2. Contract
3. Model
4. Existing Implementation
5. GitHub Issue

GitHub Issues are execution plans.
GitHub Issues are NOT architecture authority.

Before implementation begins, complete grounding in this exact sequence:
1. Read referenced ADRs.
2. Read referenced Contracts.
3. Read referenced Models.
4. Read Existing Implementation.
5. Read the GitHub Issue.

If issue guidance conflicts with ADR, Contract, Model, or Existing Implementation:
STOP.
Document conflict.
Recommend correction.
Do not implement conflicting behavior.

Required execution constraints:
- Do not redefine architecture authority.
- Do not bypass grounding sequence.
- Do not treat GitHub Issue as architecture authority.

Required outputs:
- governance-traceable implementation changes
- documented authority references
- conflict status
- closure evidence aligned to issue requirements
```

Result: PASS

## 21. Prompt Example Review

Example implementation prompt using the standard:

```text
HTBW EXECUTION GROUNDING STANDARD

Task executes: <issue-id and title>
Repository: <owner/repo>

Before coding:
1. Read ADR references: <list>
2. Read Contract references: <list>
3. Read Model references: <list>
4. Read Existing Implementation references: <list>
5. Read GitHub Issue: <issue-url>

Authority order:
1. ADR
2. Contract
3. Model
4. Existing Implementation
5. GitHub Issue

If conflict exists:
STOP.
Document conflict.
Recommend correction.
Do not implement conflicting behavior.

Execution output requirements:
- implement only authority-aligned scope
- document authority traceability
- provide validation and closure evidence
```

Result: PASS

## 22. Governance Traceability Review

Prompt traceability requirements:

- ADR references must be explicitly listed.
- Contract references must be explicitly listed.
- Model references must be explicitly listed.
- Existing Implementation references must be explicitly listed.
- GitHub Issue reference must be explicitly listed and treated as lowest authority.

Result: PASS

## 23. Governance Traceability Matrix

| Authority Surface | Prompt Requirement | Traceability Expectation |
|---|---|---|
| ADR | include ADR references first | highest authority evidence documented |
| Contract | include contract references second | boundary evidence documented |
| Model | include model references third | semantic evidence documented |
| Existing Implementation | include implementation references fourth | behavior evidence documented |
| GitHub Issue | include issue reference last | execution-only input evidence documented |

Result: PASS

Result: PASS

E15-G2 consumes and operationalizes E15-G1 without redefining authority order or conflict governance.

## 28. Roadmap Applicability Review

Standard prompt headers support roadmap execution and closure by enforcing repeatable authority validation, conflict handling, and governance traceability before implementation begins.

Result: PASS

## 29. Final Governance Assessment

Governance assessment:

- implementation prompt authority is explicitly constrained by architecture authority order.
- execution control is enforced through grounding sequence and mandatory stop conditions.
- governance traceability is explicit and reusable across repositories.

Result: PASS
